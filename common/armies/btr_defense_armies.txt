#Defensive armies can't transport of the planet
#maintenance is directly scripted here. 0.25 translates to 0.25 monthly cost (excluding other upkeep modifiers)
#morale_damage = 1		# average morale damage of the army, default: auto (calculated from morale * MORALE_DAMAGE_MULT)
#building spawned armies can't be built normally, but only created from pops working buildings

#spawn_chance: only works on defensive armies; pop scope check that lets you give weights for what sort of army should be spawned
#		Calculation is health * spawn_chance (default: 1), and it always picks the best one
