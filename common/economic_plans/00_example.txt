# Note on overwriting: the economic plans (unlike most other database objects) are additive in their overwriting, a bit like on_actions.
# This means that if you have multiple instances of e.g. "basic_economy_plan", the game will mash both entries into one.
# In practice, this means that:
# - you can add another "basic_economy_plan" with just a subplan entry, and it will add that subplan entry to the object
# - if you add a subplan entry that has the same name as an existing one, it will overwrite the existing one instead
# - if you add information that is not a subplan entry (e.g. simply "income = { }", it will usually overwrite it, depending on what exactly it is.
# To do a full overwrite of an economic plan, you should overwrite the file rather than the entry.

# Example AI Economic Plan

#example_plan = {
#	income = { # how much surplus income of resources the AI aims for
#		energy = 50
#		minerals = 200
#		food = 100
#		consumer_goods = 10
#		alloys = 100
#
#		physics_research = 200
#		society_research = 200
#		engineering_research = 200
#	}
#
#	focus = { # increased prio until surplus income of rhs value is reached
#		alloys = 20
#	}
#
#	subplan = {
#		# an entire new plan with its own potential trigger and goals
#		# if the empire fulfills the potential trigger of the subplan
#		# then its goals will be added to the base plan.
#
#		# NOTE: there can be several subplans!
#
#		# NOTE: ai_weights are NOT added from subplans, also type is NOT checked!
#	}
#
#
#	scaling_subplan = {
#		# if all sub plans are fulfilled then the scaling sub plans gets added multiple times until one of them is no longer fulfilled
#		# code loops over all scaling sub plans and adds all of them if they pass the possible trigger
#		# this allows for infinitely scaling sub plans which for example make the AI increase its alloys and science in a balanced manner
#		# NOTE: there can be several scaling_subplans!
#
#	}
#
#	optional_subplan = {
#		# optional sub plans are normal sub plans except they do not have to be fulfilled for the scaling behaviour to be enabled
#		# scaling sub plans should include things which they AI should try to do but it is not critical to do so
#		# a good example are advanced resources, they are paramount and the AI should try and get them, but it is not as critical as for example food
#	}

#	pops = 500 # number of total pops to aim for
