## NOTE: This wonky setup is to stop the even wonkier effect of two science stations being drawn on top of each other. It appears that some kind of hardcoded (or somewhere I can't find) thing will -always- paste whatever the pdxmesh is on "part1". So here I specify an empty mesh. So it can do it's crazy stuff on that, THEN I attach my actual science station "mec_asari_01_observation_station_object_entity". 
entity = {
	name = "mec_asari_01_observation_station_entity"
	pdxmesh = "mec_asari_01_empty_mesh"

	locator = { name = "part1" 		position = { 0 0 0 } }
	
	state = { name = "death" state_time = 3 looping = no
		event = { time = 2.9 particle = "small_player_ship_explosion_particle" keep_particle = yes trigger_once = yes sound = { soundeffect = "station_explosion_large" } }
	}
	
	attach = { "part1" = "mec_asari_01_observation_station_object_entity" }
}
