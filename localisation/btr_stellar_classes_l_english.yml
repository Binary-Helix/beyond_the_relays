  pc_magnetar:0 "Magnetar"
  pc_magnetar_desc:0 "Magnetars are neutron stars with an extremely strong magnetic field and an extremely high density. They may have a higher gravitation than a some black holes. Magnetars are capable of emitting such strong flashes of gamma and X-ray radiation, that they can damage electronic equipment located billions of kilometers from the star. The average life span of a magnetar is about 1 million years. Because of the strong magnetic field, movement around the magnetar is difficult, and the radiation emitted, disrupts the operation of reflectors, rendering the shields of ships and stations useless."
