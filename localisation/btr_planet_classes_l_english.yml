 dune_world:0 "Dune World"
 dune_world_desc:0 "This planet consists of an endless sea of dunes interrupted only by rare mountain ranges. In this world of desert, there are no open sources of water. Small water sources can only be found at the cooler polar caps or deep underground. Frequent sandstorms regularly grind down what is on the surface."
 dust_world:0 "Dust World"
 dust_world_desc:0 "This extremely arid world has undergone severe degredation of the soil due to continuous, uncontrolled erosion. Mighty winds occasionally raise huge dust storms that rage across the planetary surface, plunging the sky into a perpetual rusty twilight, over the centuries grinding down the mountain ranges."
 badlands_world:0 "Badlands World"
 badlands_world_desc:0 "This arid world consists primarily of extensive networks of mountain ranges spanning thousands of kilometres, forming valleys through which the streams and rivers of the planet can carry water across the surface. Most of the planet is dry and lacking flora, with what vegetation does exist, mostly in the form of shrubs and undergrowth, border the planet's bodies of water."
 aquifer_world:0 "Aquifer World"
 aquifer_world_desc:0 "A rocky world with little precipitation and no cloud cover to speak of, this planet's hydrosphere is almost entirely concentrated underneath the surface, with various manifestations at ground-level in small bodies of water. These congregations of water support the planet's entire biosphere."
 mesa_world:0 "Mesa World"
 mesa_world_desc:0 "Frequent, sometimes unpredictable, changes in the warm and cold seasons of this world lead to strong winds and drought. Over the course of many millions of years, constant weathering has transformed the planet's topography into canyon-ridged plateaus and vast mesas. The planet's meager biosphere thrives only near rare water bodies in the polar zone."
 cenote_world:0 "Cenote World"
 cenote_world_desc:0 "This rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere is dotted by millions of sinkholes and wells leading to underground tunnels, passages and fluid water streams that permeate the underlying layer of the entire planet."
 outback_world:0 "Outback World"
 outback_world_desc:0 "This scalding arid world is largely populated with shrubbery, with vast deserts extending between areas of concentration of flora. While the majority of the planet is dry, an underground system of water streams permeates the planet and occasionally manifests itself in various bodies of water, such as springs, seas and geysers."
 oasis_world:0 "Oasis World"
 oasis_world_desc:0 "This desert paradise is dominated by a single ocean, which occupies approximately a sixth of the surface. The rest of the planet is covered by extensive desert biomes hidden mostly in rain shadow. Vegegation concentrates on the coast of this great body of water, which has over time reached some distance into the desert interior."
 steppe_world:0 "Steppe World"
 steppe_world_desc:0 "Special environmental conditions and natural selection directed the evolution of the local flora along a path that completely deprived this planet of trees. The surface is covered with many inland seas, which are separated by endless plains of grassy meadows and steppe pastures."
 veld_world:0 "Veld World"
 veld_world_desc:0 "A semi-arid subtropical climate and predominantly mountainous landscape has transformed this world into a patchwork quilt of lush coastal prairies, flooded grasslands, hot savannas and desert plateaus. The local biosphere forms around some tree species that develop extensive root systems to compensate for the long dry seasons. An extensive root system can hardly exist for more than several decades, but those that continue to grow allow the trees to develop into mega-acacia trees and create around themselves a kind of oases with permanent centers of blooming life."
 medit_world:0 "Mediterranean World"
 medit_world_desc:0 "This arid, rocky world contains several large inland seas, the coasts of which are less affected by the hot climate. Many fertile regions are concentrated in the coastal regions, where a temperate climate with rare dry seasons prevails."
 retinal_world:0 "Retinal World"
 retinal_world_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, its most notable landmasses are separated by enormous bodies of water thousands of kilometres wide, with smaller archipelagos of land dotting the endless seas. Because the planet's flora is based on retinaldehyde compounds, the planet has a unique purple colouring."
 atoll_world:0 "Atoll World"
 atoll_world_desc:0 "While tectonics did not allow the formation of large landmasses on this world, it was nonetheless covered in massive undersea volcanoes constantly forming smaller islands. Over the eons, many of these volcanic islands eroded and were covered by the ocean becoming home to megacorals. The megacorals form the distinctive giant atolls of this tropical paradise. Distributed almost evenly from pole to pole, the giant coral islands of this world are a true masterpiece of natural creation."
 coastal_world:0 "Coastal World"
 coastal_world_desc:0 "A large rocky world with a stable hydrosphere that permeates the surface of the planet. The many cervices and corners of the landmass create myriad coastal regions, where the ocean circulation produces extensive rainfall. Farther inland, however, rain is less prevalent, though the planet's atmospheric currents carry much of the humidity and valuable water resources necessary for the survival of flora and fauna in these regions."
 jungle_world:0 "Jungle World"
 jungle_world_desc:0 "Stuffy, dense jungle and giant creeping roots cover the entire surface of this planet. The rich flora of this world shows incredible tenacity and growth rate in attempts to take possession of any free area of space. With such an aggressive spread of local vegetation, the development and maintenance of infrastructure is a very difficult task."
 biolum_world:0 "Bioluminescent World"
 biolum_world_desc:0 "A rocky world with a rich nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, this world exhibits a great amount of geothermal activity, causing an almost perpetual haze to hover above the surface of the planet. As a result, its indigenous lifeforms have adopted bioluminescence for hunting, protection and other vital activites."
 marsh_world:0 "Marsh World"
 marsh_world_desc:0 "This swampish planet has few grassplains to speak of. The planet is covered in thin river systems bypassing sharp sawgress congregations, leaving little room for solidified rock. Most of the planet's fauna resides in the various water systems, mostly amphibious and marine animals."
 mangrove_world:0 "Mangrove World"
 mangrove_world_desc:0 "This humid world is almost entirely covered by water, although these seas are rather shallow and act more as extremely large ponds than as continent-separating oceans. The planet is covered in vast forests of mangrove trees with bulky roots, with very little actual land above the water level."
 bog_world:0 "Bog World"
 bog_world_desc:0 "This cold world has virtually no solid soil for construction and is denied access to open mineral deposits. The entire surface of the planet is covered with peat bogs and dirty lakes. Despite the cold, harsh climate of the planet, high humidity and fertile soil make this world attractive for agriculture."
 lake_world:0 "Lake World"
 lake_world_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, this planet lacks an oceans entirely. The majority of the planet's landmass is concentrated on a singlular continent spanning the entire globe, dotted with millions of lakes of varying sizes. The remaining landmass is distributed in these lakes as small islands, usually extremely small ones spanning no more than a few square feet."
 prairie_world:0 "Prairie World"
 prairie_world_desc:0 "Great landmasses, separated by large inland seas and mountain ranges, are covered with endless fertile lands. This world is dominated by a temperate seasonal climate. Wet and hot summers last long and give way to short but cold and harsh winters."
 temperate_world:0 "Temperate World"
 temperate_world_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Given the planet's unique position in orbit around the system's sun, its surface temperature is lukewarm, manifesting itself both as hotter air currents and warmer bodies of water."
 forest_world:0 "Forest World"
 forest_world_desc:0 "This world's flora has prospered and built a monument to its greatness. The planet is covered by multi-leveled forests and jungles, the crowns of its innumerable trees tickling the sky. The animal world is diverse, but often serves only as prey for predatory plants which are abundant on the surface."
 supercon_world:0 "Supercontinent World"
 supercon_world_desc:0 "This world, coupled with a rich nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, is currently dominated by a single supercontinent that amasses all the surface area of the planet above sea level. As such, life blossoms near the coastal areas with great diversity of both flora and fauna. Farther inland, however, the supercontinent becomes dry and inhospitable, overrun with vast, seemingly endless deserts and insurmountable mountain ranges."
 hotocean_world:0 "Hot Ocean World"
 hotocean_world_desc:0 "This world is covered in its majority by a single body of water that completely encompassess all of the landmasses. An overwhelming amount of water moves in rapid and violent underwater currents, cycling energy from geothermal vents deep underwater to the surface of the ocean. As a result, the water system of the entire planet is substantially warmer than usual."
 coldocean_world:0 "Cold Ocean World"
 coldocean_world_desc:0 "This rocky world is blanketed by a thick layer of ocean spanning the entire globe and engulfing the vast majority of the planet's landmasses, with less than a tenth above the water level. The general lack of geothermal vents, the tranquility of the planet's volcanic system and the sluggish speed of the circulation currents of the planet's oceans have forced the bodies of water to mostly settle, thus lowering the temperatures greatly throughout the planet-spanning ocean."
 storm_world:0 "Storm World"
 storm_world_desc:0 "This watery planet is prone to violent storms that occur in huge numbers in the atmosphere. The small dry land of this world has turned into bare rocks, on which there is practically no life."
 basalt_world:0 "Basalt World"
 basalt_world_desc:0 "This world was once a hotbed of volcanic activity, with daily eruptions of gurgling magma covering the face of this planet. Its volcanic system has since become dormant, and most of the world's surface has cooled and condensed into basalt rock, on top of which a complex system of flora and fauna has flourished."
 lichen_world:0 "Lichen World"
 lichen_world_desc:0 "This cold and humid world has replaced the traditional flora of garden worlds with lichen, creating vast lichen forests that span the globe, edging their way through the rocky surface. The planet exhibits an extremely stable hydrosphere and predictable precipitation patterns, facilitating this growth and expansion."
 mire_world:0 "Mire World"
 mire_world_desc:0 "A cold, muddy world, this planet is seemingly an inactive ball of rock. The tectonic plates of this world are stable and nearly still, with volcanic activity dormant across the surface. The high levels of precipitation that fall all over the planet generate a high concentration of a soft and wet sludge, concentrating in various craters and valleys to form lakes of mud."
 fungal_world:0 "Fungal World"
 fungal_world_desc:0 "This once blooming world is at the mercy of a parasitic organism of unknown origin. The strange organism is a fungal supercolony that permeates the entire planet with giant hyphae, completely subjugating the biosphere. This planetary exo-mold forms a pathogen that affects not only living organisms, but also dead matter, using it for their own purposes."
 boreal_world:0 "Boreal World"
 boreal_world_desc:0 "Not so long ago (by cosmic standards), this planet survived the ice age. Now its glaciers are retreating, baring the earth that was previously covered in ice. Wild rivers and geothermal zones hidden in the depths of the moving glaciers will serve as an excellent source of energy. The low temperature and frozen lands are, however, harsh. Coniferous plants dominate its surface landscape, competing with different mosses and lichens."
 highland_world:0 "Highland World"
 highland_world_desc:0 "Much of the surface of this cold planet is a highly intricate system of mountain ranges, forming a relief of hollows, plateaus and valleys with inland seas. This world is characterized by strong elevation changes and an almost complete absence of vast plains."
 cascadian_world:0 "Cascadian World"
 cascadian_world_desc:0 "This rocky world is covered in an extensive network of mountain ranges that cover the surface of the planet. Its atmosphere, a dense mix of nitrogen and oxygen, feeds dozens of storm cycles throughout the planet amd accentuates the differences between the various seasons."
 crag_world:0 "Crag World"
 crag_world_desc:0 "This oceanic planet is dotted with archipelagos of volcanic islands. Rare pieces of land that rise above the surface of the endless ocean are clusters of prismatic structures. These outcrops are composed of a variety of effusive rocks and may contain rare valuable minerals."
 snow_world:0 "Snowball World"
 snow_world_desc:0 "A desolate world covered in blizzards and extreme storms with subfreezing temperatures, this rocky planet is engulfed in a comparable ice age of significant proportions. While the oceans are covered in a relatively thin layer of ice, the landmasses are coated in white, with snow falling on the tallest mountains and the deepest valleys."
 glacial_world:0 "Glacial World"
 glacial_world_desc:0 "Much of the surface of this planet is covered in a huge ice shell. An incredible frost reigns in this world, and deadly snowstorms prevent the development of more than a meager biosphere. The almost lifeless landscape consists of ice rocks and occasionally weathered cliffs, opening access to rare minerals under the surface of the planet."
 antar_world:0 "Antarctic World"
 antar_world_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, the planet is entirely frozen over with negligable water to speak of on the surface of the planet. This makes the exposed surface of the planet hostile to organic life; however, both deep underwater and in the cave and underground systems that run through the planet, the conditions are far more amicable. As such, flora and fauna can flourish here."
 glaciovolcanic_world:0 "Glaciovolcanic World"
 glaciovolcanic_world_desc:0 "This is a large, rocky and forzen world with a dense nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and an extremely high level of tectonic plate activity, which translates to a higher-than-usual level of volcanic activity for a frozen world. This volcanic activity has generated a breathable atmosphere and concentrations of life near the various bodies of water it creates."

 pc_hot_giant:0 "Hot Giant"
 pc_hot_giant_desc:0 "This gaseous planet is known as a 'hot giant', as they are most popularly known for having extremely high temperatures underneath its thick clouds. This is largely thanks both to its proximity to its star as well as its surface-atmosphere composition, which captures much of its own heat. They are commonly a step between an average gas giant and a brown dwarf."
 pc_ice_giant:0 "Ice Giant"
 pc_ice_giant_desc:0 "This gaseous planet is an 'ice giant', composed primarily of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and sulfer. They lack well-defined solid surfaces, like habitual gas giants, but are primarily composed of gases and liquids. Because of this, they are an entirely different form of gas giant; indeed, as many of their gases are trapped in water ice, the term 'ice giant' is more accurate."
 pc_brown_dwarf:0 "Brown Dwarf"
 pc_brown_dwarf_desc:0 "This planet is a brown dwarf, a substellar object that, while not massive enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in their inner cores, are capable of fusing deuterium and lithium. These massive planets, however, maintain relatively low surface temperatures, emitting most of their light in the infrared range."
