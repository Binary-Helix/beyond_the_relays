 d_blue_zone:0 "The Blue Zone"
 d_blue_zone_desc:0 "The planets seas are a dark brown on account of the immense amount of Alkaline Metals dissolved into them, except for one of them. one of the smaller inland seas on the planet is a bright and vibrant blue. Many of our scientists have announced their intention to study this phenomena and determine its cause."
 d_thunderless:0 "Thunderless"
 d_thunderless_desc:0 "Because of the nature of Chlorine, thunderstorms are almost impossible on this world. This seems strange to some due to the high humidity and precipitation on the world. Regardless, the lack of fears over lightning and thunder and the consistent rain requires adaptations."
 d_purple_haze:0 "Purple Haze"
 d_purple_haze_desc:0 "Methane worlds are famous for appearing as a fuzzy ball of blue/turquoise or beige gas rather than the sharp edges of most planets. However, this planet is purple and our scientists cannot understand why.

With some investment and skill we can make use of the exposed subterrainian areas and possibly even make use of the residual pools of acid at the bottom of the pit."
 d_toxic_waters:0 "Impure Waters"
 d_toxic_waters_desc:0 "Since the atmosphere of this planet is comprised of different gasses from that of most other planets it is no surprised that some of those gasses become dissolved in the local water supply.

 d_caustic_vents:0 "Caustic Vents"
 d_caustic_vents_desc:0 "There are large vents at the bottom of this ocean world where noxious gasses are spewed into the ocean above. This creates a very intense upward current that runs continuously. Also, the local fauna has somehow been able to adapt to this gas and are capable of living in relatively close conditions to the vents themselves. "
 d_retinal_flora:0 "Retinal Flora"
 d_retinal_flora_desc:0 "The plants on this planet are a slightly different color from what we are used to due to the differences in atmosphere which is somewhat disconcerting but also intriguing to many of our citizens. Especially our scientific community."

 d_deaths_plateau:0 "Deaths Plateau"
 d_deaths_plateau_desc:0 "The toxic gases in this planets atmosphere are much lighter than oxygen and while they can be found at all elevations they concentrate at high levels. This creates extremely toxic enviorments that even the local fauna cannot survive at some of the higher points on the world. "
 d_duneless_sands:0 "Dune-less Sands"
 d_duneless_sands_desc:0 "Because the atmosphere of this planet is lighter than oxygen the winds are much weaker than other worlds and the air offers less resistence to motion.

Instead the sand largely sorts itself in much larger deserts than we had ever imagined with very little change in elevation. "
 d_fuming_hot_springs:0 "Fuming Hot Springs"
 d_fuming_hot_springs_desc:0 "Trapped far beneath this area is a large body of water being gradually squeezed out of the planets crust by the movement of the rock around it. Trapped within this body of water is a large concentration of the more noxious gasses that make up the planets atmosphere. As the water bubbles up through cracks in the ground the gas escapes as a seemingly never ending trail of bubbles emerge from the spring, the preassure and speed at which the water moves also increases its temperture which is quite nice on a world as cold as ours."
 d_desolate_slopes:0 "Desolate Slopes"
 d_desolate_slopes_desc:0 "The many mountain ranges that weave through this planets surface all have a very distinct and unique feature. very visible line roughly two thirds the way up the moutain that seperates the habitable atmosphere from the overly toxic atmosphere. Sparse vegitation lives just below the line but nothing survives above it and not a single creature on the planet will venture near the line, no matter what danger faces them on the lower side. It is caused by the concentration of lighter gases higher in the atmosphere than on other worlds but knowing its cause does not make it any less awe inspiring or dangerous."
 d_venting_lake:0 "Venting Lake"
 d_venting_lake_desc:0 "Beneath this lake is believed to be a massive pocket of trapped noxious gas. As lake has eroded the ground beneath it, and time has allowed the gas to preasure the rock above it small cracks have formed that allow the gas to slowly leak through the lake to the surface. The preassure appears to be so great that no water can travel down into the pocket which prevents the lake from becoming entirely subterranian. The gas can be seen in the cold air and the movement and heat that it generates allows for portions of the lake to remain liquid despite the thick ice along its shores."
