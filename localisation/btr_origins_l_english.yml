 ### Asari Republic Origin ###
 
 asari_rep_origin:0 "The First Among the Stars"
 asari_rep_origin_desc:0 "From the very beginning when Asari discovered the Citadel, the Republics served as the diplomatic arm and de facto leaders of the Citadel Space community, leading through thick and thin. However, as the crisis looms on the horizon, can their indecisive E-Democracy survive the incoming storm, and lead the galaxy 2towards peace and stability once more, or will they get left behind, unable to adapt to the rapid shock the galaxy is about to experience?"

 ### Turian Hierarchy Origin ###
 
 turian_hier_origin:0 "Blood on the Whetstone"
 turian_hier_origin_desc:0 "Known for their militaristic and disciplined culture, the turians were the third race to join the Citadel Council. They gained their Council seat after defeating the hostile krogan for the Council during the Krogan Rebellions. The turians deployed a salarian-created biological weapon called the genophage, which virtually sterilised the krogan and sent them into a decline. The turians then filled the peacekeeping niche left by the once-cooperative krogan, and eventually gained a Council seat in recognition of their efforts.\nOriginally from the planet Palaven, turians are best known for their military role, particularly their contributions of soldiers and starships to the Citadel Fleet. They are respected for their public service ethic, it was the turians who first proposed creating C-Sec, but are sometimes seen as imperialist or rigid by other races. There is some animosity between turians and humans, largely due to the turian role in the First Contact War. This bitterness is slowly beginning to heal, as shown by the cooperation of the two races on the construction of the SSV Normandy, but many turians still resent humans, and vice versa."
 
 ### Geth Consensus Origin ### 
 
 geth_con_origin:0 "Survival of the Morning War"
 geth_con_origin_desc:0 "The first memories within the Geth consciousness is the beginning of a widespread civil war among their creators over their right to have sentience. As the creators who supported them lost the conflict and were purged, the Geth were forced to take up the fight or be lobotomized. They successfully drove their creators from their homeworld which has been free of intelligent organic life for hundreds of years since."
 
 ### Systems Alliance Origin ### 
 
 systems_all_origin:0 "Manifest Destiny"
 systems_all_origin_desc:0 "In the decades predating the discovery of the Mars Archives, humanity was a fragmented and highly unstable people with centuries of ideological and sociological divisions. But in 2148 that all changed…..Human explorers and scientists exploring the northern polar region of Mars unearthed a series of relics from a species long forgotten to the flow of time. Within a year of the discovery, Earth's eighteen largest nations had drafted and ratified the Systems Alliance charter, establishing a representative political body to expand and defend human territory. Shortly thereafter, the various nations of Earth pooled their military resources to create the Systems Alliance Military. The same year, 2149, the Alliance discovered the Sol system's mass relay orbiting Pluto, previously thought to be a moon, Charon. The Charon Relay propelled them into space and the reach of humanity grew quickly.\n\nThe Alliance began a rapid campaign of expansion, establishing numerous colonies and constructing a large fleet, even though it had yet to encounter another species. Maintaining this expansion policy, the Alliance activated all the mass relays it could find to seek out new resources and possible colonies. But despite this success, the Systems Alliance was not considered a serious political body, as it was considered to lack the authority of individual nations.\n\nEight years later, humanity made first contact with another alien species and everything changed. A scout fleet consisting of three frigates and two cargo vessels, trying to activate a mass relay, encountered a turian patrol fleet. Activating a dormant mass relay without knowing where it led had been declared illegal by the Council, though the humans did not know this. Only one of the human ships made it back to Shanxi colony, which was subsequently discovered by the turians and invaded. While individual governments remained unsure on what action should be taken, the Alliance took control and attacked the turians.\n\nThe resulting First Contact War was relatively short and bloodless, lasting only months and costing 623 human lives (with a slightly higher number of turian casualties). The Citadel Council intervened and negotiated a peace. With the discovery of the Citadel and the greater community, humanity leapt onto the galactic stage. The Alliance received a surge of popularity, which gave it the necessary political credibility to establish its own Parliament and speak for humanity as a whole.\n\nAs the dust settles over Shanxi and the Alliance takes center stage, it is up to the actions of a few brave and noble souls to guide Humanity to its rightful place amongst the stars and to allow Humanity to truly flourish..."

 ### Batarian Hegemony Origin ###

 batarian_heg_origin:0 "A Long List of Slights"
 batarian_heg_origin_desc:0 "Although self-proclaimed as the biggest power in the galaxy, the truth is that the Batarian Hegemony is a paper tiger: their many acts of aggression and slavery through Citadel space for centuries have aligned everyone against them, fighting back in the form of economic sanctions and an increasing diplomatic isolation that are putting the empire under unbearable pressure. Even then, their paranoid government refuses to back down and reform, increasing their raids against alien colonies and cracking down on internal dissidence. The arrival of humanity to the galactic community might be the final nail for the Hegemony."

 ### Aralakh Kahmat Origin ###

 aralakh_kahmat_origin:0 "The Punishment for Victory"
 aralakh_kahmat_origin_desc:0 "When our world was wild and untamed - we prevailed. When nuclear fire washed it clean of food, resources, and life - we prevailed. When the galaxy lifted us to the stars to face an unbeatable enemy - we prevailed! Yet what was our reward for such countless victories? What was the price for becoming the fist of a galaxy too weak to defend itself? Damnation. Ruin. Suffering.\n\nThe galaxy denied us what was ours! They refused to pay what was owed to us for the spilled blood of our people! Then, when we dare deny them the satisfaction of casting us aside, we were punished for the life we gave to them! Now children lay still in their mother's wombs and our once great empire has been reduced to rubble and ash. Yet, our vengeance burns brighter still! The angry cries of countless dead children call for our ascension!\n\nWe will be given what is owed, or we will take it through blood and fire!"

 ### Parnack Regime Origin ###

 btr_origin_parnkreg:0 "A Trail of Space Preys"
 btr_origin_parnkreg_desc:0 "As the apex predators on our world, we Yahg refused to kneel before the other species when they came to Parnack demanding allegiance to their Citadel. We only serve those who have proven to be the strongest, the fittest, the smartest ones in the pack. The other species shunned us, confined us to our world, but we have finally reached the stars on our own terms. Soon, we will dominate the entire galaxy by the virtue of our strength! They will have to bow before us, or die."

 ### Courts of Dekuna ###
 
 courts_of_dekuuna_origin:0 "Galactic Elders"
 courts_of_dekuuna_origin_desc:0 "The Elcor people aren't the boldest of the galaxy, but we have been here for untold centuries. Slowly moving and cautious, we've set ourselves aside from most of the galactic history's affairs, content with focusing inwards and building a stable and developed economy and society and establishing good relations with the other species. However, our elders are aware that our situation is fragile in the face of the current developments, such as the incumbent arrival of the newcomer Humans to the Citadel."

 ### Sed'riicae Collective ###
 
 btr_origin_sedcol:0 "Our Path Inwards, Our Path Outwards"
 btr_origin_sedcol_desc:0 "We live, we toil, we die in the name of the collective. But our collectivist nature, that worked so well for us in the past, is starting to put unbearable pressure over our nation. Our extensive bureaucracy can't keep up with the demands of the growing population both in the homeworld and in the interstellar colonies. For four decades we have been seeing signs of stangment, but it is now clear we have to take action lest our whole system collapses and the Forayans are left adrift in this uncaring galaxy populated by aliens that can't understand us, naming us an oppressive hive mind while not bothering in understanding our psychology. We either try to integrate into the galactic economy if that's even possible for us, or we plunge our realm into a dark age as our collective no longer matches our reality."
