    ### DUNE ###
    building_aegis:0 "Ammos Aegis"
    building_aegis_desc:0 "A massive wall, more similar to a giant damn that wraps around until it connects with itself, this structure defends our most important settlements from the endless tides of sand and sand storms. It is expensive to construct and just as expensive to maintain but without it we most likely could not form urban centers on this world."

    ### DUST ###
    building_hydrator:0 "Atmospheric Hydrator"
    building_hydrator_desc:0 "This goliath spire juts out of the dead soil on the planet and appears to be covered in a perpetual fog at the top. However, that fog is actually the moisture being emitted into the atmosphere to help restart this planet's water cycle and bring life back to the ground below. With its help we will be able to start using the dirt for more than just a surface on which to plant buildings. It also puts us in near total control of the planets water cycle until enough water has been introduced for it to become self sustaining."

    ### BADLANDS ###
    building_barracks:0 "Roughneck Barracks"
    building_barracks_desc:0 "The rugged terrain of this planet makes standard governance difficult and breeds a more harder culture than that of our core worlds. Having a strong contingent of soldiers on hand and ready to move at a moments notice goes a long way toward asserting our authority and protecting the world from threats of all kind."

    ### AQUIFER ###
    building_complex:0 "Ground Water Reclaimation Complex"
    building_complex_desc:0 "This large complex and its subsidiary outposts pump an awe inspiring quantity of water from the seemingly endless seas underneath the planets surface. This water allows our citizens a nearly unlimited supply to with as they please."

    ### MESA ###
    building_canyon:0 "Urban Canyon"
    building_canyon_desc:0 "A planet covered in canyons, like veins spreading across the surface, would habitually be a difficult place to inhabit. Violent wildlife and extreme season shifts are proving hostile to our settlements. However, our engineers have devised a new habitat structure, built into the walls of the canyons, effectively using them both as a source of water and as cover from the sun and heat, saving us energy we'd otherwise invest in keeping temperatures stable."

    ### CENOTE ###
    building_sinkhole:0 "Sinkhole Mining Infrastructure"
    building_sinkhole_desc:0 "Tapping into the richest deposits down in the depths of the sinkholes dotting #name requires special regulations, training and equipment due to extreme hazards of such undertaking. All of these elements in place will ensure our miners can extract minerals safely and effectively."

    ### OUTBACK ###
    building_hydro:0 "Hydro Mining Station"
    building_hydro_desc:0 "Knowing that this planet has large amounts of water trapped beneath its surface we can begin prospecting for these pockets of water and then dig down to liberate the water for use by our settlers. Depending on where these pockets are located they may allow us to create settlements far into the otherwise uninhabitable desert regions."

    ### OASIS ###
    building_canal:0 "Planetary Canal System"
    building_canal_desc:0 "A system of canals that span the entire planet connecting the vast majority of the planetary oases. Potentially capable of being seen from nearby planets it brings life to what was previously uninhabitable stretches of the planets surfaces."

    ### STEPPE ###
    building_retreat:0 "Galactic Retreat"
    building_retreat_desc:0 "The vast calming meadows and grassy flatlands are considered extremely beautiful by many across the galaxy. If given the opportunity and the relevant infrastructure many would gladly travel to spend time enjoying this uncommonly serene planet."

    ### VELD ###
    building_operations:0 "Ground Taming Operations"
    building_operations_desc:0 "This planet has large stretches of untamed land that could become productive given a large enough investment. While it is unlikely that any individual could handle the cost of such an endeavor the government could easily find the resources to begin breaking the ground and removing the many large rock outcroppings. If we chose to undertake this program it would go a long way to reducing the planets reliance on expensive hydroponics for its food supply."

    ### MEDITERRANEAN ###
    building_aqueduct:0 "Aqueduct System"
    building_aqueduct_desc:0 "While the coastal areas of this planet are well suited to habitation the rest of the world is not. If we were able to bring water from the rainy, temperate regions to the arid interior it would open much more land to our settlers. Ideally this would be done automatically with as little upkeep as possible, our engineers believe that gravity is the best option if we can take advantage of it."

    ### RETINAL ###
    building_retinal:0 "Retinal Power Plant"
    building_retinal_desc:0 "The abundance of retinal reactive compounds on this planet provides us an opportunity to take advantage of a more powerful solar reaction that what we can artifically create. While this material requires very specific conditions that the planet has in abundance it does force us to isolate the power generation chambers from our crews as our pressence can be dangerous to the retinal compounds that we are employing. It also requires us to harvest large quantities of the retinal reactive material from the surrounding flora although our biologists are confident that this will not harm the ecosystem so long as we only take small samples from each plant."

    ### ATOLL ###
    building_relay:0 "Relay Boost Stations"
    building_relay_desc:0 "The tiny islands on this planets are scattered across truly massive distances on this planet. While we can route our travel through an orbital station or move rapidly through the mid atmosphere these both require far more time and effort than traditional travel by car. We can install a series of scaled up Mass Effect powered boosters to essentially bounce or toss our vehicles from one to the next. While it isn't as convenient as a tiny mass relay network it is the best we could do with our understanding of the technology."

    ### COASTAL ###
    building_resort:0 "Luxury Resort"
    building_resort_desc:0 "Much of our world is dedicated to the production of the vital necessities needed to maintain the habitability and relative self-sufficiency of our colony. However, our people deserve to relax and enjoy the liberties that our empire has to offer, and what better way to do that than to offer a luxurious stay at the beautiful coastal regions of our world?"

    ### JUNGLE ###
    building_plant:0 "Sustainable Agricultural Plant"
    building_plant_desc:0 "The planet is one large jungle covered in trees and roots throughout the surface. However, we can use this to our advantage: the planet's temperate conditions offers a unique environment for the cultivation of some of the most coveted fruits in the galaxy. We can construct a sustainable agricutlraul plant on this world and exploit that natural resource. "

    ### BIOLUMINESCENT ###
    building_lodge:0 "Exotic Hunting Lodge"
    building_lodge_desc:0 "This world's unique geothermal activity has given rise to something not common on most other worlds: a biosphere that almost universally employs bioluminescence for a variety of different functions. This fauna has a particular distinct look and, especially, taste, and would make for an exquisite luxury item on the dinner table."
