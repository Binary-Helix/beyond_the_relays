 dune_world:0 "Dune World"
 dune_world_desc:0 "This planet consists of an endless sea of dunes interrupted only by rare mountain ranges. In this world of desert, there are no open sources of water.

 badlands_world:0 "Badlands World"
 badlands_world_desc:0 "This arid world consists primarily of extensive networks of mountain ranges spanning thousands of kilometres, forming valleys through which the streams and rivers of the planet can carry water across the surface. Most of the planet is dry and lacking flora, with what vegetation does exist, mostly in the form of shrubs and undergrowth, border the planet's bodies of water.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 aquifer_world:0 "Aquifer World"
 aquifer_world_desc:0 "A rocky world with little precipitation and no cloud cover to speak of, this planet's hydrosphere is almost entirely concentrated underneath the surface, with various manifestations at ground-level in small bodies of water.

 mesa_world:0 "Mesa World"
 mesa_world_desc:0 "Frequent, sometimes unpredictable, changes in the warm and cold seasons of this world lead to strong winds and drought. Over the course of many millions of years, constant weathering has transformed the planet's topography into canyon-ridged plateaus and vast mesas. The planet's meager biosphere thrives only near rare water bodies in the polar zone.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"

 veld_world:0 "Veld World"
 veld_world_desc:0 "A semi-arid subtropical climate and predominantly mountainous landscape has transformed this world into a patchwork quilt of lush coastal prairies, flooded grasslands, hot savannas and desert plateaus. The local biosphere forms around some tree species that develop extensive root systems to compensate for the long dry seasons. An extensive root system can hardly exist for more than several decades, but those that continue to grow allow the trees to develop into mega-acacia trees and create around themselves a kind of oases with permanent centers of blooming life.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 medit_world:0 "Mediterranean World"
 medit_world_desc:0 "This arid, rocky world contains several large inland seas, the coasts of which are less affected by the hot climate. Many fertile regions are concentrated in the coastal regions, where a temperate climate with rare dry seasons prevails.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 retinal_world:0 "Retinal World"
 retinal_world_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, its most notable landmasses are separated by enormous bodies of water thousands of kilometres wide, with smaller archipelagos of land dotting the endless seas.

 atoll_world:0 "Atoll World"
 atoll_world_desc:0 "While tectonics did not allow the formation of large landmasses on this world, it was nonetheless covered in massive undersea volcanoes constantly forming smaller islands.

 supercon_world:0 "Supercontinent World"
 supercon_world_desc:0 "This world, coupled with a rich nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, is currently dominated by a single supercontinent that amasses all the surface area of the planet above sea level.

Farther inland, however, the supercontinent becomes dry and inhospitable, overrun with vast, seemingly endless deserts and insurmountable mountain ranges.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 hotocean_world:0 "Hot Ocean World"
 hotocean_world_desc:0 "This world is covered in its majority by a single body of water that completely encompassess all of the landmasses. An overwhelming amount of water moves in rapid and violent underwater currents, cycling energy from geothermal vents deep underwater to the surface of the ocean. As a result, the water system of the entire planet is substantially warmer than usual.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 coldocean_world:0 "Cold Ocean World"
 coldocean_world_desc:0 "This rocky world is blanketed by a thick layer of ocean spanning the entire globe and engulfing the vast majority of the planet's landmasses, with less than a tenth above the water level. The general lack of geothermal vents, the tranquility of the planet's volcanic system and the sluggish speed of the circulation currents of the planet's oceans have forced the bodies of water to mostly settle, thus lowering the temperatures greatly throughout the planet-spanning ocean.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 storm_world:0 "Storm World"

 fungal_world:0 "Fungal World"
 fungal_world_desc:0 "This once blooming world is at the mercy of a parasitic organism of unknown origin. The strange organism is a fungal supercolony that permeates the entire planet with giant hyphae, completely subjugating the biosphere.

 boreal_world:0 "Boreal World"
 boreal_world_desc:0 "Not so long ago (by cosmic standards), this planet survived the ice age. Now its glaciers are retreating, baring the earth that was previously covered in ice.

 glacial_world:0 "Glacial World"
 glacial_world_desc:0 "Much of the surface of this planet is covered in a huge ice shell.

 antar_world:0 "Antarctic World"
 antar_world_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, the planet is entirely frozen over with negligable water to speak of on the surface of the planet.

As such, flora and fauna can flourish here.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 glaciovolcanic_world:0 "Glaciovolcanic World"
 glaciovolcanic_world_desc:0 "This is a large, rocky and forzen world with a dense nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and an extremely high level of tectonic plate activity, which translates to a higher-than-usual level of volcanic activity for a frozen world.

 hot_giant:0 "Hot Giant"
 hot_giant_desc:0 "This gaseous planet is known as a 'hot giant', as they are most popularly known for having extremely high temperatures underneath its thick clouds. This is largely thanks both to its proximity to its star as well as its surface-atmosphere composition, which captures much of its own heat. They are commonly a step between an average gas giant and a brown dwarf."

They lack well-defined solid surfaces, like habitual gas giants, but are primarily composed of gases and liquids. Because of this, they are an entirely different form of gas giant; indeed, as many of their gases are trapped in water ice, the term 'ice giant' is more accurate."
 brown_dwarf:0 "Brown Dwarf"
 brown_dwarf_desc:0 "This planet is a brown dwarf, a substellar object that, while not massive enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in their inner cores, are capable of fusing deuterium and lithium.
