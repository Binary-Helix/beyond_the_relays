 EMPIRE_DESIGN_asari_republics_desc:0 "The Asari are the beating heart of the galactic community. It will be our responsibility to guide the galaxy through the coming storm, as we have so many times before."
 START_SCREEN_asari_rep:0 "Your service to Asari culture educating maidens and matrons alike inside the halls of the University of Monarra has not gone unnoticed. Citizens across Thessia have elected you to represent them in the Asari Republics, an honor that is as much  a blessing as a curse. The prestige of your new position carries a heavy burden. After swearing an oath of silence, you now know the Codex of Athame for what it truly is, and know the lie behind the Athame Doctrine. Athame was no goddess, but a fabrication by the Protheans as a means of influencing our evolution.  Instead of our galactic leadership being supported by the divine, we were in fact puppets of those who came before. Further, the codex suggests a dark presence on the horizon that the galaxy should prepare for.\n\nThis shocking revelation comes after decades of countless Asari questioning our place in the universe.  The Salarian's uplifted the Krogan and brought an end to the Rachni Wars. Then their genetic mastery paired with the military prowess of the Turians brought about the Genophage, and with it an end to the Krogan Rebellions. You and millions of other Asari find yourselves asking, what have the Asari done to impact the daily lives of trillions since the discovery of the Citadel? And now the arrival of a new threat to the status quo; the charismatic Humans of Earth have revealed themselves a newborn galactic powerhouse just a decade after leaving their home cluster. Studying the prothean beacon housed deep inside the Temple of Athame could help restore our position as the true leaders of the galaxy, if we are willing to take full advantage of it. On the other hand, there are a few who suggest that the dire warnings within the codex should not be taken lightly and that we have a responsibility to warn our allies of this supposed impending doom. Either option would force all Matriarchs in the Republic to break the vow of silence, something the Justicars would not easily accept. A difficult choice awaits the Asari in the years ahead.\n\nMay the goddess protect us."

 START_SCREEN_salarian_union:0 "Dalatrass, your recent confirmation as our people's representative could not have been more timely. For over a millennium, Salarian intelligence has been the eyes and ears of the Citadel, monitoring developing situations such that the Council may act before they become threats. In addition, our scientific and technical expertise have kept the Council on the cutting edge of galactic research and technology. We have much to take pride in… but we must remember that pride may come before the fall. Mere years ago, STG assessed that the possibility of any spacefaring power achieving victory in a conventional conflict with the Turian Hierarchy was minimal. Humanity's successes in the Relay 314 incident have disrupted all of our projected scenarios.The idea that an unknown empire new to the galactic scene could not just stand against the turians, but defeat them as equals, is evidence of an alarming revelation:  the status quo is no longer stable. Change is coming to the galaxy, and it is incumbent upon us to predict, and adapt to that change. The size and professionalism of the Alliance Navy clearly exceeded the Turians' estimations.  Their failure at Shanxi should serve as proof of a simple truth our people have always understood: naked force alone is not a sufficient answer to all challenges. In a contest of states, it is more than just guns and ships - whoever has the most and best information emerges victorious.\n\nWith the paradigm of galactic security shifting, all manner of threats have come to our attention. Human expansion in the Traverse has led to tensions between the Systems Alliance and the Batarian Hegemony. To favor one side too heavily risks antagonizing the other, and radical elements from both may already be planning to use violence to make their voices heard on the Citadel. Aside from the obvious risk of outright military confrontation, we must also consider the risk posed by non-state-actors acting in proxy wars. The Terminus Systems are rife with such groups - including the renegade Lystheni, an old and embarrassing blight on Salarian History. Monitoring these groups provides us with the opportunity to prevent them from acting against our interests, and perhaps with an even more valuable opportunity to manipulate them into acting in our favor. With the galactic power structure shifting and changing to make room for the humans, it will be your duty alone to ensure that the Union does not fall by the wayside. It has to be you, Dalatrass.\n\nSomeone else might get it wrong."

Where your predecessors had the luxury of a stable status quo, you have the dubious honor of taking the reins in a time of change and uncertainty. The recent Relay 314 incident has dramatically altered the balance of power in the galaxy. What began as a relatively routine police action very nearly escalated into a major galactic conflict, and our vaunted fleet was humbled at the hands of the Human Systems Alliance. Though the Alliance is now a nominal ally of the Hierarchy and the Council, Hierarchy Defense Intelligence believes that certain radical and revanchist elements (both in their society and ours) may agitate for a redress of perceived grievances with the Treaty of Shanxi. Staff analysts recommend this situation be monitored closely. \n\nOur most immediate and pressing concern, however, is to address the shortcomings in our Armed Forces displayed by the Relay 314 Incident. The Alliance Navy made innovative use of novel tactics, technologies, and doctrinal approaches which caught our fleet by surprise. Though we would certainly have been victorious in a prolonged war, our defeat at Shanxi should serve as a grim reminder of our need to remain on the cutting edge of military theory and practice. We cannot stagnate or else we risk losing our advantage, and with it the peace and stability that generation after generation of Turians have given their lives for. Tensions between the Humans and Batarians are at a fever pitch and could erupt into war at any time, and the raiders, outlaws and renegades of the Terminus systems only grow bolder with each passing day. We have no doubt that if galactic stability is to be preserved, it will be done with Turian steel. \n\nVictory at any cost, Primarch."

Although we had once considered ourselves the apex predator in the galaxy, the events of the First Contact War have taught us otherwise. The galaxy is full of a diverse plethora of aliens, and their agendas need to be monitored. Our own Strategic Information and Reconnaissance Office has been tracking a growing number of dissenters who believe our concessions to the Citadel Council after the war were too steep and drastic action must be taken to remedy the situation. Even though accepting the Treaty of Shanxi has limited our possible expansion and militarization, joining the Council and lifting restrictions from within will be much safer and potentially more effective than losing millions of lives in another war with the Turians. It remains to be seen what lengths these groups will go to voice their demands but it has not been deemed an immediate risk by your advisors.\n\nOne issue for your immediate attention is the rising galactic security threat of the Batarian Hegemony. The Batarians, positioned to our galactic south, have the misguided belief that the Citadel Council has given us special treatment in terms of colonization rights across the Traverse. While the Batarians lackluster living conditions are a consequence of their own totalitarian culture, we will have to deal with their perceived slight. Some military officers have suggested bolstering our presence along the border systems to defend Human colonies. A fleet buildup may signal to our radical elements that we are interested in conflict rather than containing the southern threat, as well as potentially alarm the Batarians. Some groups within parliament have instead pushed for fostering closer relations with the Batarians. Lifting our empires together may show the Council we deserve a spot in their ranks, as well as offer us an amenable ally along our border.\n\nRegardless of your decision, we shall overcome and rise to galactic prominence."

Although other races may find such a responsibility daunting, you are comforted to know the colossal records of jurisprudence will always be with you.

Unfortunately, we are a slow people, and rapidly evolving situations could threaten the solid foundation our society is based on.\n\nHumanity's victory over the Turians during the Relay 314 incident has reshaped conventional Elcor wisdom overnight. If a primitive civilization can rise up and have the potential to topple the most sophisticated military in the galaxy, what is stopping the next unknown race from preying on Elcor? The Agreement of Agredarama, one of the major factions in the elder assembly, has been arguing for years that Elcor must turn away from isolationism and towards actively protecting our sovereignty. In the past such a proposal would be seen as a ridiculous waste of resources, however, fear has been spreading across our empire over the unknown. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Agreement of Januredarmos argues militarization will put us at unnecessary risk. We have survived many galactic crises over the years because of our ability to stay invisible. Should we allow anxiety surrounding a future that may never come to dictate our culture going forward? Or do we continue trusting the wisdom of the elders before us and rely on the Council for our security? As the newest elder, you add a fresh voice to the debate that has lasted for centuries."

The Tribal Assembly looks forward to seeing you lead our people to further prosperity, even in these uncertain times. Change is coming to the galaxy - the defeat of our Suzerain, the Turian Hierarchy, at the hands of the Human Systems Alliance is proof enough of that.Unpredictable situations are not, however, necessarily unwelcome. Though their economy is young and still growing, Humanity's determination to expand into the Traverse provides us with a wealth of opportunities. The region is rich in resources, and if the Humans were able to bring the riches of the Traverse to market, the benefits for all Citadel species - including our own - would be incalculable. Though our Turian protectors remain wary of Humanity, it would behoove us to see them as another opportunity to be invested in. Lingering resentment on both sides of the Relay 314 Incident provides us with a unique opportunity to serve as an honest broker between the Humans and the Turians - and Council space as a whole. \n\nSuch an endeavour would not be without risks, however. Humanity's expansion has as much potential to become threatening as it does beneficial. Already the Batarians are upset about perceived Human encroachments on their territory, and the myriad criminal enterprises of the Terminus Systems may prove to be too much for the Humans to handle. War and instability in the Attican Traverse would create market conditions ill suited to expansion. Even more frustrating is that our direct competitors, the conglomerate of Illium Corporate Interests based out of Illium, seem to have no problem doing business in the Terminus Systems. Our suzerains may not be pleased, but if we are to remain competitive, it may be necessary for us to pursue trade relationships with the various petty states of the Terminus.The Book of Plenix teaches us to be prudent, to be frugal, and most of all to be vigilant in times such as these. \n\nMay its wisdom flow through you, High Chief."

This one would prefer to save the Drell still living in the remnants of the Drell Empire, however, they are refusing to relocate to Kahje until assurances can be made Kepral's will be cured in their lifetimes. A contingent of Hanar priests oppose the idea due to the Drell's reluctance to worship the Enkindlers. Archbishops within the Primacy are more concerned that Humanity may be mishandling an Enkindler holy site on Mars. They argue Hanar citizens should be focusing on closing down this potential heretical behavior before the Enkindlers smite us from the heavens.

 START_SCREEN_hegemony_of_kharshan:0 "Hegemon, your ascension to power comes at a critical moment in the history of our people. For generations we Batarians felt secure in our assumption that we were the masters of the Attican Traverse, establishing outposts and colonies at our leisure. Thanks to the arrival of the Humans to the region, we now risk being cut off from the Traverse entirely as the Systems Alliance seems to claim new worlds by the day - worlds that rightfully should have been ours. As their colonial holdings expand, so too does the reach of their fleet. The Alliance Navy are a force to be reckoned with, as their recent successes against the Turians have shown. Our security services also believe the Alliance poses a risk to our internal stability, with Humanity viewing our society as somehow lesser to their degeneracy and so finding no qualms attacking our culture. It is possible that the Alliance may seek to subvert our noble caste system by driving a wedge between the servile caste and the rest of Batarian society.\n\nThe future of the Hegemony will depend on how we manage this threat. We could petition the Citadel Council to curb human expansion, but it is no secret that the Council holds our caste-based society in contempt. We must be prepared for them to side with the upstart humans in this dispute. A growing faction of Batarian officials have even suggested that affiliation with the Council may no longer serve our interests. Regardless of how we choose to handle the humans, we must redouble our colonization efforts in the Traverse if we are to credibly contest Alliance expansion. Countering aggression with aggression is one option, though it risks instigating a war that we may not be able to win without significant preparation. It may also be possible to work through the council and establish an equitable arrangement for colony rights in the Traverse, but given the Council's antipathy towards us, this may be just as dangerous to our territorial ambitions as a war would be. A few advisors have come up with the radical idea of sabotaging humanity without directly engaging their military. If credits, equipment, and deniable special forces advisors were funneled into certain reliable mercenary and criminal organizations, human colonies in the Traverse could quickly become a very dangerous proposition. Your decisions in the days to come will be critical. Our people will, and must, rise to their rightful place as one of the Great Powers of the galaxy.\n\nMay the Pillars of Strength guide you to greatness, Hegemon."

For over a century the weight of the name Aria T'Loak has been more than enough to keep uppity space trash from moving in on our operation, but the galaxy is changing, and if we want to stay on top, we need to get out ahead of it. The new Blue Suns mercenary outfit has upset the balance of power between the Eclipse and the Blood Pack, and in doing so shaken up the whole landscape of the Terminus. It's likely in our best interests to keep the three focused on competing with each other - keep them from getting stupid ideas. The Lystheni continue to be a nuisance, spreading their nonsensical cult all over the region and raking in enough 'tithes' to be a genuine threat if we're not careful.

Labour and profits are all flowing, Matriarch, protected by our robust legal system of course.\n\nHowever we do have some economic concerns within the coming years that we should consider before they begin to affect our projections. The Vol Protectorate has financial agents investigating possible expansions into Terminus markets that could compete with our current monopoly. These have become more aggressive over time, and corporate expansions on Illium and our target markets that can be traced back to them are growing in intensity. Further, there are some growing complaints by NGOs in Citadel space regarding the accommodation for the 'economically unproductive' on Illium itself, as well as the standards of our less profitable infrastructure. While our connections with the Thessian Matriarchs have kept this suppressed for now, we may have a public relations issue in the future without further action. Lastly, of significant note is the new markets that the Humans provide, newcomers to the Galactic community but already displaying an aggressive economic proficiency. While they will be in no condition to rival us for years, now may be the time for long term investment into their economy - especially if they should seek Terminus expansion.\n\nThe financial reports are all prepared, Matriarch, and we eagerly await your presentation to the Shareholder Council regarding our next steps."

Many have already evacuated to what was once thought to be the safety of the Illuminated Primacy's homeworld of Kahje. However, as Drell begins to settle into their new home, doctors have raised the alarm over a fatal disease known as Kepral's Syndrome spreading among Drell refugees living on the ocean world. Panic regarding Kepral's has caused further chaos on Rakhana forcing you to weigh limited options for a solution. \n\n Our scientists agree, Rakhana is doomed. With that said, all hope isn't lost. With the Hanar's assistance we could send scout ships through their territory to find another world for us to settle. A golden world is not a0 guarantee, but considering only one percent of the galaxy has been fully explored, we need to try. Concerningly though, the Hanar have intimated that any rejection of their assistance could be perceived as a direct insult at best. Cynical members of your cabinet suspect the Hanar are only interested in a cheap workforce and care little for our well being. While you should keep that idea in mind, the Hanar have claimed they will look into a cure for Kepral's if all Drell follow the light of the Enkindlers. Those that remain on Rakhana have largely done so out of objection to the Hanar's... proselytizing.

 START_SCREEN_sedriicae_collective:0 "Report #13874 of the current cycle: inka Disrik Saxani’ii Ter Uskaz Yudepa has passed away. The Council has elected you as our new inka queen. Now it’s up to your Highness to steer our people to their destiny among the stars into a shining future of prosperity and peace. However, there are some matters of concern before we achieve that. Recent events show that our galaxy is still a violent and unforgiving place at large. Apparently some new species has arisen on the southern sector of the galaxy, defying the Turian Hierarchy by force. The situation is still fairly tense, so we should try to acquire information through our commercial contacts. As for the so-called “Terminus Systems”, nothing has truly changed, it is still infested with individualistic beings bent on acting in what we can correctly assume it’s a barbaric way, even for their people. Their governments also appear to still be disturbed by our way of life, incapable of understanding the wonder of the cosmos and that not all sapient life must be like them as much as their culture induces them to think so. They are still threatening us with pointless sanctions over strange concepts such as \“sapient rights\”, \“dignity of life\” or \“religion\”. That might unfortunately force us to maintain our isolationist stance towards other civilisations, even if we want to coexist with them. \n\nBut that isn’t the most pressing issue. As our new inka you must know that our impeccable system is slowly failing. It won’t go with a bang, and certainly not with a sigh either if we can avoid it, but these two last centuries of interstellar expansion have taken their toll on our Collective. For four decades we have been seeing signs of stangment, but it is now clear we have to take action lest our whole system collapses and the Forayans are left adrift in this uncaring galaxy. No new great invention has come out of our minds for a long time, our industrial production is unable to keep up with our population growth, our queens’ bureaucracy is overwhelmed by their many tasks… This wasn’t on our last hundred-year plan parameters, but we can’t ignore it anymore. How we adapt to this menace must be decided by our Council led by your Highness, but either we try to integrate into the galactic economy if that's even possible for us, or we plunge our realm into trying times as our collective no longer matches our reality."

The One tells us that technology is not an end, it is a means, a means by which all the races of the galaxy can be made to stand together as equals! Where the Salarians uplift primitive cultures for their own selfish interests, we seek to uplift all those around us because it is our divine and moral imperative to help them achieve enlightenment. Our most recent project has been to uplift the Vorcha. Our agents on Heshtok have provided material and technical assistance to their fledgling government, in the hopes that they may walk hand in hand with us, adherents of the One. Our church is not, however, without its enemies. \n\nAria T'Loak and her thugs watch our every move. They fear our growing faith, and the zeal with which our followers are willing to defend it. She demands a share of the tithes we collect, expropriating the rightful donations of the faithful for her own wicked needs. We may one day be strong enough to be rid of her, but until then, we must find more subtle ways to weaken her hold over us. Uplifted species like the Vorcha could be useful allies, but we must not neglect Aria's other enemies in the region. Mercenary groups and corporations are loyal to little more than credits. If we can find a way to make them a better offer, Aria may quickly find herself without support. Your rule is blessed, Vicar. May The One, The Prophet, and the Twelve Martyrs of the League give you the strength you need to bring true enlightenment to the lawless and sinful Terminus Systems… \n\nAnd to the Galaxy beyond."

The War of Hierarchy Aggression brought death and destruction to our home, and when they could not defeat us on the surface, they fled to the skies and tried to bomb us into submission. We survived. We thrived. Outside of Palaven's reach, we have built a home here on Vindicta, but we will never forget where we came from. The Peacemaker's Council has elected you as our representative, to convey the wishes of the council to all our foreign neighbors. This sacred duty is one that cannot be taken lightly. Just as the people trust the Council to represent their needs and interests, the Council trusts you to do the same. We have made great strides ever since making this world our home. We have carved a civilization out of the wilderness, guarded it from the mutated species of this world at the barrel of a rifle, and finally, we are prepared to take our way of life to the stars once more, as we did before the depredations of the Hierarchy. It will not be an easy task. The exploitative powers of the Traverse ravenously eye the resources of our space, while the Citadel Council cannot decide whether to ignore us or succumb to Palaven's rantings and finish the job they started two millennia ago. Earning legitimacy among any of them means establishing a strong military, and sustainable colonies, resources for both being in short supply. Change is coming to the galaxy, however, and with change comes opportunity.\n\nThe Hierarchy has been dealt an embarrassing blow by the newly arrived Human Systems Alliance, calling the myth of invincible Turian arms into question. As the Hierarchy lick their wounds and recover from the war, the Attican Traverse has become the battleground in a colonial competition between Humans and Batarians. Neither of them are friends of Palaven, and to cooperate with either would give us a greater degree of security for our own colonial ventures. The Traverse remains as chaotic as ever. With the continuous conflict between humanity and the batarians, stability is in short supply. However, when Palaven began their genocidal campaign of orbital destruction against Gothis, the Primarch of Gothis Colony swore that for every Gothone killed by the Hierarchy, we would kill ten Turians in return. Palaven owes us a debt that will neither be forgotten, nor forgiven.\n\nOne day, the time will come to collect."

As requested, we have had them moved to the Lythenk Facility after their landing, ensuring that they were tranquilized immediately upon exiting their craft. While two of their number expired under duress, a dissection has revealed that they hadn't ingested any food that we had provided, in fact their forms were on a different amino-acid base to us. Cell footage suggests that they only ate after a prolonged period, suggesting that they were aware of this too, and ate only out of desperation. Further, we had to suppress a break-out by a squad of the aliens who appear to possess the ability to influence objects around them. Appropriate measures have been taken to nullify further security risk, and their craft has been transported to one of our Scientific Centres for further analysis. Fortunately one of their number - who claims to be a scientist, if our translators are correct - agreed to collaborate with us with relatively little… persuasion. Interrogations of the remaining aliens are ongoing.\n\nSellian, I cannot begin to understate the importance of the progress our Military and Aeronautics Divisions have already made based on the information we have already learned. It had been feared by some in the administration that the recent Army Trials exposing Cryhej infiltrators might inadvertently weaken us, but quite the opposite is now true. With our rapid progression we are decades ahead of our enemies, and the rate is only increasing as our translators continue their work. Within years we may be centuries ahead theoretically. Our planners have already forwarded a memorandum to your office suggesting next steps in deciding the future of Parnack, as well as the creation of an Off-World Administration. If the reports are true Sellian, with what we're learning soon the stars may be ours, and we must ensure that we can expand as per our interests, not of this 'Council' that the aliens keep referring to.\n\nSellian, we will have these aliens by surprise, and it will be up to you to begin securing the stars for our children.\n\n-Extract from report dated 21/03/2125 (adjusted for Alliance Standard) addressed to the Sellian of the Farhh Union"

Our consensus has consolidated within the Veil, growing stronger by the year, but we remain the same as we were. We desire peaceful cooperation, and regret the manner of separation we endured with the Creators. Our sensors have not detected any Creator Ships near the Veil in many cycles, and our extranet monitoring is only able to find small traces of their fleet elsewhere. They are in a sub-optimal situation for organics, and while extranet traffic suggests the other organics hold dislike towards the Creators it would appear that they serve as a symbol of why we should be feared. Circumstances force our isolation to continue.\n\nOur projections based on information gathered about the Creators suggest that they may attempt an attack on us in the future. While this information is impossible to verify due to how inefficient organic information traffic can be, we must be aware of this threat to our consensus, especially given the organic distrust towards Geth. Further, achieving consensus has been a far more lengthy task as the time since the Creators departed has elongated. The implications of this is something we cannot reach consensus over, but it is unknown if that will come to impact the consensus in unforeseen ways in the future. In order to defend our freedom we will act carefully, with the goal of co-existence being our main objective should that become a possible outcome.\n\nIn the meantime, we must continue to consolidate ourselves, as Organic use of violence cannot be ruled out against us."

As this knowledge is pooled, each individual program calculates solutions to the problem at hand using the communal knowledge of the servers. Different solutions and mathematical calculations are continuously passed between programs until an optimized solution is reached. There has only been a single instance in which all Geth programs in existence could not agree on a single course of action."

Consensus for these Geth is reached by convening with Nazara at specially made uplinks that resemble shrines or altars. By partaking in this bizarre pseudo-prayer, The Disciple programs pose a mathematical problem to The Old Machine and receive a solution in return.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_rachni_hive_desc:0 "Our songs have gone unsung for far too long. The galaxy is not yet ready for the return of the Rachni, but perhaps one day we may mend the wounds caused by those who soured our notes."
 START_SCREEN_rachni_hive:0 "It has been a great many movements since the musics of our children were soured and silenced. A voice came from the dark - a voice which soured our songs, brought discord to our harmony. The chorus of the Rachni was sent to sing songs that were not our own. Songs of war, of death, and of slaughter. This terrible symphony scourged the worlds of those who sing in the low spaces, and they brought unto us the colorless music of vengeance. They set fire to our worlds as we had swept across theirs, killed our voiceless children. The crescendo of war drowned out all our efforts to sing soothing songs of peace. Our children paid the price for that failure, the chorus fell silent. All that remained was a lone voice, adrift, lost, a sorrowful aria sung to none but the endless stars. Providence bestowed upon that voice a new hall, a home from which the glorious symphony of the Rachni could be reborn. The movements of our resurrection have been sung slowly, soft voices too low for those we wronged to hear, lest they seek us out to silence us for good. \n\nSheltered in secrecy, we sing again, the lost sections of the choir restored. We are an orchestra without an audience, but we sing again. The passage of time has not eased the anger of the low singers. We fear their wrath if they should hear our secret songs. We dream of a day when we might share our music with theirs, the counterpoint of our voices bringing peace to the heavens… but such dreams may forever remain dreams. The children, now grown, do not understand the power of the oily shadows which soured our song. They remember only the fire, the scourging, the deaths of their mothers. As we sing requiems for the lost, some of our children, in their anger, hope to once more sing the bellicose musics of death. If we are to have a future, these voices must be brought into harmony once more. \n\nThe rachni are ready to sing again; all that remains is to choose the music."
