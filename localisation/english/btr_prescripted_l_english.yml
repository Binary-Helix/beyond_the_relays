 EMPIRE_DESIGN_asari_republics_desc:0 "From the very beginning when Asari discovered the Citadel, the Republics served as the diplomatic arm and de facto leaders of the Citadel Space community, leading through thick and thin. However, as the crisis looms on the horizon, can their indecisive E-Democracy survive the incoming storm, and lead the galaxy towards peace and stability once more, or will they get left behind, unable to adapt to the rapid shock the galaxy is about to experience?"
 START_SCREEN_asari_rep:0 "Your service to Asari culture educating maidens and matrons alike inside the halls of the University of Monarra has not gone unnoticed. Citizens across Thessia have elected you to represent them in the Asari Republics, an honor that is as much  a blessing as a curse. The prestige of your new position carries a heavy burden. After swearing an oath of silence, you now know the Codex of Athame for what it truly is, and know the lie behind the Athame Doctrine. Athame was no goddess, but a fabrication by the Protheans as a means of influencing our evolution.  Instead of our galactic leadership being supported by the divine, we were in fact puppets of those who came before. Further, the codex suggests a dark presence on the horizon that the galaxy should prepare for.\n\nThis shocking revelation comes after decades of countless Asari questioning our place in the universe.  The Salarian's uplifted the Krogan and brought an end to the Rachni Wars. Then their genetic mastery paired with the military prowess of the Turians brought about the Genophage, and with it an end to the Krogan Rebellions. You and millions of other Asari find yourselves asking, what have the Asari done to impact the daily lives of trillions since the discovery of the Citadel? And now the arrival of a new threat to the status quo; the charismatic Humans of Earth have revealed themselves a newborn galactic powerhouse just a decade after leaving their home cluster. Studying the prothean beacon housed deep inside the Temple of Athame could help restore our position as the true leaders of the galaxy, if we are willing to take full advantage of it. On the other hand, there are a few who suggest that the dire warnings within the codex should not be taken lightly and that we have a responsibility to warn our allies of this supposed impending doom. Either option would force all Matriarchs in the Republic to break the vow of silence, something the Justicars would not easily accept. A difficult choice awaits the Asari in the years ahead.\n\nMay the goddess protect us."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_salarian_union_desc:0 "Knowledge is not only power, but the sword to which the Salarian Union puts its enemies. Despite being the co-founding race of the Citadel Council, the Salarians have the third-weakest economy in Citadel Space and an undersized fleet to match - but only fools see this as a sign of Salarian weakness. A labyrinthine bureaucracy and a web of intelligence services veil The Union in an impenetrable shadow of secrecy, out from which their all-seeing eyes peer into the galaxy."
 START_SCREEN_salarian_union:0 "Dalatrass, your recent confirmation as our people's representative could not have been more timely. For over a millennium, Salarian intelligence has been the eyes and ears of the Citadel, monitoring developing situations such that the Council may act before they become threats. In addition, our scientific and technical expertise have kept the Council on the cutting edge of galactic research and technology. We have much to take pride in… but we must remember that pride may come before the fall. Mere years ago, STG assessed that the possibility of any spacefaring power achieving victory in a conventional conflict with the Turian Hierarchy was minimal. Humanity's successes in the Relay 314 incident have disrupted all of our projected scenarios.The idea that an unknown empire new to the galactic scene could not just stand against the turians, but defeat them as equals, is evidence of an alarming revelation:  the status quo is no longer stable. Change is coming to the galaxy, and it is incumbent upon us to predict, and adapt to that change. The size and professionalism of the Alliance Navy clearly exceeded the Turians' estimations.  Their failure at Shanxi should serve as proof of a simple truth our people have always understood: naked force alone is not a sufficient answer to all challenges. In a contest of states, it is more than just guns and ships - whoever has the most and best information emerges victorious.\n\nWith the paradigm of galactic security shifting, all manner of threats have come to our attention. Human expansion in the Traverse has led to tensions between the Systems Alliance and the Batarian Hegemony. To favor one side too heavily risks antagonizing the other, and radical elements from both may already be planning to use violence to make their voices heard on the Citadel. Aside from the obvious risk of outright military confrontation, we must also consider the risk posed by non-state-actors acting in proxy wars. The Terminus Systems are rife with such groups - including the renegade Lystheni, an old and embarrassing blight on Salarian History. Monitoring these groups provides us with the opportunity to prevent them from acting against our interests, and perhaps with an even more valuable opportunity to manipulate them into acting in our favor. With the galactic power structure shifting and changing to make room for the humans, it will be your duty alone to ensure that the Union does not fall by the wayside. It has to be you, Dalatrass.\n\nSomeone else might get it wrong."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_turian_hierarchy:0 "§MTurian Hierarchy§"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_turian_hierarchy_desc:0 "Known for their militaristic and disciplined culture, the turians were the third race to join the Citadel Council. They gained their Council seat after defeating the hostile krogan for the Council during the Krogan Rebellions. The turians deployed a salarian-created biological weapon called the genophage, which virtually sterilised the krogan and sent them into a decline. The turians then filled the peacekeeping niche left by the once-cooperative krogan, and eventually gained a Council seat in recognition of their efforts.\nOriginally from the planet Palaven, turians are best known for their military role, particularly their contributions of soldiers and starships to the Citadel Fleet. They are respected for their public service ethic, it was the turians who first proposed creating C-Sec, but are sometimes seen as imperialist or rigid by other races. There is some animosity between turians and humans, largely due to the turian role in the First Contact War. This bitterness is slowly beginning to heal, as shown by the cooperation of the two races on the construction of the SSV Normandy, but many turians still resent humans, and vice versa."
 START_SCREEN_turian_hierarchy:0 "As Primarch of Palaven, and supreme commander of the largest fleet in the Galaxy, the burden of providing security for Citadel Space rests on your shoulders. Where your predecessors had the luxury of a stable status quo, you have the dubious honor of taking the reins in a time of change and uncertainty. The recent Relay 314 incident has dramatically altered the balance of power in the galaxy. What began as a relatively routine police action very nearly escalated into a major galactic conflict, and our vaunted fleet was humbled at the hands of the Human Systems Alliance. Though the Alliance is now a nominal ally of the Hierarchy and the Council, Hierarchy Defense Intelligence believes that certain radical and revanchist elements (both in their society and ours) may agitate for a redress of perceived grievances with the Treaty of Shanxi. Staff analysts recommend this situation be monitored closely. \n\nOur most immediate and pressing concern, however, is to address the shortcomings in our Armed Forces displayed by the Relay 314 Incident. The Alliance Navy made innovative use of novel tactics, technologies, and doctrinal approaches which caught our fleet by surprise. Though we would certainly have been victorious in a prolonged war, our defeat at Shanxi should serve as a grim reminder of our need to remain on the cutting edge of military theory and practice. We cannot stagnate or else we risk losing our advantage, and with it the peace and stability that generation after generation of Turians have given their lives for. Tensions between the Humans and Batarians are at a fever pitch and could erupt into war at any time, and the raiders, outlaws and renegades of the Terminus systems only grow bolder with each passing day. We have no doubt that if galactic stability is to be preserved, it will be done with Turian steel. \n\nVictory at any cost, Primarch."

 START_SCREEN_systems_alliance:0 "Having just been elected to the position of  Prime Minister, it is important you understand the past few years have been a humbling experience for the Human race. Although we had once considered ourselves the apex predator in the galaxy, the events of the First Contact War have taught us otherwise. The galaxy is full of a diverse plethora of aliens, and their agendas need to be monitored. Our own Strategic Information and Reconnaissance Office has been tracking a growing number of dissenters who believe our concessions to the Citadel Council after the war were too steep and drastic action must be taken to remedy the situation. Even though accepting the Treaty of Shanxi has limited our possible expansion and militarization, joining the Council and lifting restrictions from within will be much safer and potentially more effective than losing millions of lives in another war with the Turians. It remains to be seen what lengths these groups will go to voice their demands but it has not been deemed an immediate risk by your advisors.\n\nOne issue for your immediate attention is the rising galactic security threat of the Batarian Hegemony. The Batarians, positioned to our galactic south, have the misguided belief that the Citadel Council has given us special treatment in terms of colonization rights across the Traverse. While the Batarians lackluster living conditions are a consequence of their own totalitarian culture, we will have to deal with their perceived slight. Some military officers have suggested bolstering our presence along the border systems to defend Human colonies. A fleet buildup may signal to our radical elements that we are interested in conflict rather than containing the southern threat, as well as potentially alarm the Batarians. Some groups within parliament have instead pushed for fostering closer relations with the Batarians. Lifting our empires together may show the Council we deserve a spot in their ranks, as well as offer us an amenable ally along our border.\n\nRegardless of your decision, we shall overcome and rise to galactic prominence."
