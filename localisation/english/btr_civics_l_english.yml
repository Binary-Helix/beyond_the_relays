    batarian_caste_system:0 "Caste System"
    batarian_caste_system_desc:0 "Batarian people have traditionally lived under a rigid social hierarchy based on one self's wealth. This caste system has supposedly allowed them to thrive and prosper to such an extent that all aliens envy their glorious nation: aristocrats rule to ensure that everyone is cared and provided for, and serfs work the land and industry.

    volus_flexible_government:0 "Flexible Government"
    volus_flexible_government_desc:0 "After millennia of rejecting physical conflict or organized war, the Volus have developed a cultural aversion to many other forms of conflict. In order to resolve disputes and handle divergent interests, a clan based system developed, which allowed members of clans to be traded and for entire clans to be absorbed or divided very organically. This would later influence the Volus government, which is famed for its flexibility. While the government rapidly and dramatically shifting its structure and makeup can confuse outsiders and lead to redundant bureaucracy, the Volus greatly appreciate how reflective and responsive it is to changes in the population."
