 hegemony_of_kha_all_mighty_state_desc:0 "The Hegemony acts as a bulwark against all enemies, both internal and external, real or potential, in the name of batarian freedom, even if that means brainwashing, monitoring and repressing their own people.

 hegemony_of_kha_caste_system:0 "Caste System"
 hegemony_of_kha_caste_system_desc:0 "Batarian people have traditionally lived under a rigid social hierarchy based on one self's wealth. This caste system has supposedly allowed them to thrive and prosper to such an extent that all aliens envy their glorious nation: aristocrats rule to ensure that everyone is cared and provided for, and serfs work the land and industry. Some call it slavery, but surely that just shows their disrespect for the pride ways of the batarian people."

 vol_pro_flexible_government:0 "Flexible Government"
 vol_pro_flexible_government_desc:0 "After millennia of rejecting physical conflict or organized war, the Volus have developed a cultural aversion to many other forms of conflict. In order to resolve disputes and handle divergent interests, a clan based system developed, which allowed members of clans to be traded and for entire clans to be absorbed or divided very organically. This would later influence the Volus government, which is famed for its flexibility. While the government rapidly and dramatically shifting its structure and makeup can confuse outsiders and lead to redundant bureaucracy, the Volus greatly appreciate how reflective and responsive it is to changes in the population."

 geth_con_civic_collective_conscious_desc:0 "While the Geth do not feel emotions, or at least claim not to, their actions have revealed a conscience and a form of morality within their collective consciousness.

 sedriicae_collective_status_intellectus_desc:0 "Extremely rare are the individuals of this species who have modes of thought beyond their own interests in their free time and the advancement of the collective. For this species, their sense of duty to their people and their government overpowers any other feeling. This almost religious devotion to the state surrounds the forayan species with secrecy and isolates them from a hard-to-understand individualistic galaxy."
 sedriicae_collective_desperate_measures:0 "Deasperate Measures"
 sedriicae_collective_desperate_measures_desc:0 "It is now clear that our highly centralised ancient state culture, which made us thrive when we only populated a single planet, isn't enough for a spacefaring society. Considering the aliens' success, we must follow the lead of the Terminus Systems to reinforce our economy through any means necessary and secure our future among the stars. The best way is to follow our neighbors' suit and find new ways to improve our industry through cheap workforce."

They are extremely loyal and many are more than willing to lay down their lives on our command."

 yahg_pack_mentality:0 "Pack Mentatlity"
 yahg_pack_mentality_desc:0 "Yahg society is built around a pack mentality. A group of yahg will not cooperate until a single leader has attained dominance through either social maneuvering or brute force.

 omega_common_cause:0 "A Common Cause"
 omega_common_cause_desc:0 "The inhabitants of Omega are all there for the same reason and they know it. While they may not get along personally, there is a shared desire to live outside the laws and restrictions of most other states in the Milky Way. This can lead to tolerance of actions and situations that would cause riots on other planets or even have certain things praised despite being crimes elsewhere in the galaxy."
 omega_broken_mirror:0 "A Broken Mirror"

This corporation is one of the biggest stakeholders of the Illium Executive Committee and most of the wealthy Matriarchs and Matrons that dominate Illium's economy and politics are important shareholders of the IDF.

 illium_cor_indentured_servitude_desc:0 "A regional hub of Asari commerce awash in riches, Illium is infamous for its abusive labor practices and legalization of nearly everything except murder, made even more lucrative by legal indentured servitude for individuals that can't repay their debts. At the same time, it is still an Asari world and far from lawless, so this slavery is still regulated to ensure the servants' needs and rights are respected."
 illium_cor_gateway:0 "Gateway to the Terminus"
 illium_cor_gateway_desc:0 "Illium is a commerce planet, and sees many new cultures and goods due to its proximity to the Terminus Systems. As such, drugs are legal as long as they are labeled properly, and one can buy any kind of weapon, technology, or even indentured servants.

 caleston_dir_segmented_society:0 "Segmented Society"
 caleston_dir_segmented_society_desc:0 "The various domes of Caleston serve almost as self contained cities. Travel between them is not banned but it is incredibly difficult and only the largest domes have direct connections. It is typically easier to take a orbital shuttle from one dome to the next but that is far too expensive for most people. This means that most of the residents do not leave the dome they were born into and when they do travel between domes they almost always have to go through a security checkpoint."
 caleston_dir_neon_glare:0 "Neon Glare"
 caleston_dir_neon_glare_desc:0 "Caleston is technically governed by Administrators assigned by a central planetary government to each dome but in function it is run by whoever wants to pump money into the system.
