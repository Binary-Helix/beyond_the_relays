 d_mineral_rich_delta:0 "Mineral Rich Delta"
 d_mineral_rich_delta_desc:0 "Rich mineral deposits were identified near one of the largest river deltas on the planet. While deposits are plenty, their extraction might prove difficult, as there is little solid ground to stand on in this planet, especially near any water body, making any engineering prospect tricky, with mining operations being hampered even more than surface constructions."
 d_heart_of_grove:0 "Heart of the Grove"
 d_heart_of_grove_desc:0 "Studying the Mangrove trees that populate nearly every meter of the planet a pattern has emerged that we believe is the result of the species colonizing the planet from the area it evolved in. Tracing the pattern backwards we discovered a relatively small region where the density of the mangroves was so great we could not go more than a handful of paces before being blocked. It is believed that these were the original mangroves that all others stem from."
 d_endless_mud:0 "The Endless Mud"
 d_endless_mud_desc:0 "Cold, moist mud covers virtually entire surface of this planet, making construction and mining immensely expensive, laborious and dangerous prospects. However, these conditions are optimal for agriculture, as long as hardy, reasonably cold resistant plants are used. "

 d_bottomless_mud_lakes:0 "Bottomless Mud Lakes"
 d_bottomless_mud_lakes_desc:0 "While mud lakes are relatively common on the surface of this world, they are habitually less than a metre deep, making it relatively easy both to avoid them and to recover any equipment or goods that find themselves stuck in them. However, some of these lakes, noticeably larger than the others, are vast lakes several dozen metres deep, making them a hazard to ground transportation."
 d_holy_realm:0 "Holy Realm"
 d_holy_realm_desc:0 "There is no question the surface of this planet is hellish, with fungi spreading across the world with ease. However, there is one particular highland region that the fungi seem unable to explore for reasons that elude us. It is there where, with luck, we'll be able to settle our first colonies with ease."
 d_great_blue_spot:0 "Great Blue Spot"
 d_great_blue_spot_desc:0 "While virtually the entire surface of this planet is covered in incessant blizzards and snowstorms, all but one have run their course and peter out with time.

It provides hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of safe space for our colonies to grow and thrive. "
 d_empyrean_lakes:0 "Empyrean Lakes"
 d_empyrean_lakes_desc:0 "The planet is covered in vast lakes of extremely warm water, formed in the aftermath of the eruptions of this world's frantic volcanic system. These lakes are densely concentrated with the life forms indigenous to this planet."
 d_hydric_soil:0 "Hydric Soil"
 d_hydric_soil_desc:0 "This planets soil is so waterlogged that it is not suitable for construction and can even cause rippling when walked on similar to wading into water. However, it is so soft and malleable that contact explosives had a difficult time detonating and explosions produce significantly less debris."
 d_organic_islands:0 "Organic Islands"
 d_organic_islands_desc:0 "Within the large pools of water that make up the surface of the world there are "dry zones" where the foliage is so dense that overlapping roots, and shrub brushes create mats that can be used as platforms safe from the water directly beneath."
 d_disease_factory:0 "Disease Factory"
 d_disease_factory_desc:0 "The stagnant water and abundance of insects on this world has led to it naturally generating diseases at a staggering rate with many of them rapidly evolving into even more diseases. While many of these are currently harmless to us quite a few have proven to be capable of infect our species and others have the ability to adapt to our physiology. "
 d_rolling_mists:0 "Rolling Mists"
 d_rolling_mists_desc:0 "At certain points of the year conditions align to create large clouds of fog that envelope the planet like a tide following the day night cycle.

 d_creeping_tendrils:0 "Creeping Tendrils"
 d_creeping_tendrils_desc:0 "One of the local plants is a vine like species that primarily exists on the water line of the swamp infested planet. Yet a portion of the plant will grow to the tallest height it can find by 'climbing' before releasing pollen during the typical mating season on the planet. It has a clear fondness with our structures and while it is not dangerous to the buildings themselves, windows, doors, and other fixtures to the buildings do regularly get damaged. "
 d_blue_zone:0 "The Blue Zone"
 d_blue_zone_desc:0 "The planets seas are a dark brown on account of the immense amount of Alkaline Metals dissolved into them, except for one of them. one of the smaller inland seas on the planet is a bright and vibrant blue. Many of our scientists have announced their intention to study this phenomena and determine its cause."
 d_thunderless:0 "Thunderless"
 d_thunderless_desc:0 "Because of the nature of Chlorine, thunderstorms are almost impossible on this world. This seems strange to some due to the high humidity and precipitation on the world. Regardless, the lack of fears over lightning and thunder and the consistent rain requires adaptations."
 d_purple_haze:0 "Purple Haze"
 d_purple_haze_desc:0 "Methane worlds are famous for appearing as a fuzzy ball of blue/turquoise or beige gas rather than the sharp edges of most planets. However, this planet is purple and our scientists cannot understand why. Regardless of the cause, our population is enthralled by this unique oddity and it has quickly become a popular destination for tourists. "
 d_deadly_clouds:0 "Deadly Clouds"
 d_deadly_clouds_desc:0 "The planets atomosphere is toxic to nearly every form of life with the clouds formed within its atomosphere being nothing less than concentrated death. However, the gas that comprises these clouds is flamable and they seem to regularly travel at what would be gail force speeds on other planets."
 d_shifting_valley:0 "Shifting Valley"
 d_shifting_valley_desc:0 "The planet is going through a very violent and tumultuous time in its development which causes areas to radically change in biome, climate, and topography extremely quickly. This process can be very destructive but also very insightful into how other planets developed as well as lucrative as immense amounts of energy is released during each transformation. "
 d_acidic_sinkhole:0 "Acidic Sinkhole"
 d_acidic_sinkhole_desc:0 "This planet has a massive chasm created by rain water pooling under the soil and becoming acidic before slowly dissolving the ground around it. Eventually the ground above became so unstable that it collapsed inward exposing a large area that would otherwise have been covered. With some investment and skill we can make use of the exposed subterrainian areas and possibly even make use of the residual pools of acid at the bottom of the pit."
 d_toxic_waters:0 "Impure Waters"
 d_toxic_waters_desc:0 "Since the atmosphere of this planet is comprised of different gasses from that of most other planets it is no surprised that some of those gasses become dissolved in the local water supply. Unfortunately we can't drink this water but as a silver lining the gas within this water is flamable which has certain benefits to our scientific research."
 d_caustic_vents:0 "Caustic Vents"
 d_caustic_vents_desc:0 "There are large vents at the bottom of this ocean world where noxious gasses are spewed into the ocean above. This creates a very intense upward current that runs continuously. Also, the local fauna has somehow been able to adapt to this gas and are capable of living in relatively close conditions to the vents themselves. "
 d_retinal_flora:0 "Retinal Flora"
 d_retinal_flora_desc:0 "The plants on this planet are a slightly different color from what we are used to due to the differences in atmosphere which is somewhat disconcerting but also intriguing to many of our citizens. Especially our scientific community."
 d_green_hell:0 "Green Hell"

 d_deaths_plateau:0 "Deaths Plateau"
 d_deaths_plateau_desc:0 "The toxic gases in this planets atmosphere are much lighter than oxygen and while they can be found at all elevations they concentrate at high levels. This creates extremely toxic enviorments that even the local fauna cannot survive at some of the higher points on the world. "
 d_duneless_sands:0 "Dune-less Sands"
 d_duneless_sands_desc:0 "Because the atmosphere of this planet is lighter than oxygen the winds are much weaker than other worlds and the air offers less resistence to motion. These two things have made the formation of sand dunes much rarer than we are used to in desert climates. Instead the sand largely sorts itself in much larger deserts than we had ever imagined with very little change in elevation. "
 d_fuming_hot_springs:0 "Fuming Hot Springs"
 d_fuming_hot_springs_desc:0 "Trapped far beneath this area is a large body of water being gradually squeezed out of the planets crust by the movement of the rock around it. Trapped within this body of water is a large concentration of the more noxious gasses that make up the planets atmosphere. As the water bubbles up through cracks in the ground the gas escapes as a seemingly never ending trail of bubbles emerge from the spring, the preassure and speed at which the water moves also increases its temperture which is quite nice on a world as cold as ours."
 d_desolate_slopes:0 "Desolate Slopes"
 d_desolate_slopes_desc:0 "The many mountain ranges that weave through this planets surface all have a very distinct and unique feature. very visible line roughly two thirds the way up the moutain that seperates the habitable atmosphere from the overly toxic atmosphere. Sparse vegitation lives just below the line but nothing survives above it and not a single creature on the planet will venture near the line, no matter what danger faces them on the lower side. It is caused by the concentration of lighter gases higher in the atmosphere than on other worlds but knowing its cause does not make it any less awe inspiring or dangerous."
 d_venting_lake:0 "Venting Lake"
 d_venting_lake_desc:0 "Beneath this lake is believed to be a massive pocket of trapped noxious gas. As lake has eroded the ground beneath it, and time has allowed the gas to preasure the rock above it small cracks have formed that allow the gas to slowly leak through the lake to the surface. The preassure appears to be so great that no water can travel down into the pocket which prevents the lake from becoming entirely subterranian. The gas can be seen in the cold air and the movement and heat that it generates allows for portions of the lake to remain liquid despite the thick ice along its shores."

 d_asari_cresyl_plateau:0 "Cresyl Plateau"
 d_asari_cresyl_plateau_desc:0 "Formed during the Diodechus Period, the Cresyl Plateau is a 130km region that was once submerged under the ocean. As a result, the plateau is teeming with fossils, minerals and carbon. Whilst the majority of the region is now protected due to its outstanding natural beauty, some areas are still excavated for resources. This region continues to fuel the development of local settlements and has been vital in the development of the Asphine industrial complex. Recent estimates predict that the region could provide another thousand years worth of minerals."
 d_asari_askasian_mountains:0 "Askasian Mountains"
 d_asari_askasian_mountains_desc:0 "The Askasian mountain range is home to Thessia's highest peaks, as well as its most treacherous terrain. Whilst tens of thousands have now climbed to the summit of Mount Jithri, the mountain still maintains its difficulty and notoriety. Recent geological surveys have found an abundance of mineral resources deep below the range. The quantity and quality of these minerals will ensure that Thessia has a constant supply of raw resources for centuries to come. Careful excavations are underway to ensure that the mountain range above does not destabilize from any mining operations."
 d_asari_pulian_delta:0 "Pulian Delta"
 d_asari_pulian_delta_desc:0 "Since the advent of asari civilization, the Pulian Delta has been a vital region for agriculture due to its fertility and biodiversity. Estimated to provide up to 8% of Thessia's food, the region has been fought over and controlled by hundreds of different nations throughout history. It was not until the formation of modern e-democracies that the region was given special recognition and came to be considered the universal birthright of all asari, placed under the jurisdiction of a neutral council."
 d_asari_senecan_lakes:0 "Senecan Lakes"
 d_asari_senecan_lakes_desc:0 "The northern lakes of the Seneca region are renowned for their natural beauty, as well as their vital importance to the Republic of Ovida. The lakes alone are estimated to be responsible for nearly 15% of Ovidas national income due to tourism and irrigation to neighboring republics. In recent history, concerns grew as to the overexploitation of the lakes, with a memorium put in place which saw an immediate ban on fishing and irrigation, nearly decimating the local agricultural industry. Now, however, the lakes are beginning to flourish once more with continued strict resource management and care."
 d_asari_irssal_tea:0 "Irssal Tea"
 d_asari_irssal_tea_desc:0 "The irssal plant is known across Thessia for its beautiful and vivid flowers, but most importantly, for its sweet smell and taste, Whilst the tea is easily available across Thessia, it remains a favourite due to its timeless aroma and simplicity.

 d_asari_eezo_deposits:0 "Element Zero Deposits"
 d_asari_eezo_deposits_desc:0 "The planet is awash in all forms of eezo present in water, soil, flora and even fauna, with many native lifeforms having evolved either biotic mutations or immunity. Eezo makes up the backbone of Thessia's economy and sees ubiquitous use in many industrial, medicinal, scientific and consumer areas. Non-biotically adapted tourists are advised to stick to the visitors menu, as even food and drink on Thessia are typically served with small amounts of element zero."
 d_asari_thessia_net:0 "Thessia Planetary Network"
 d_asari_thessia_net_desc:0 "Thessia's extensive communications infrastructure synergizes digital and physical networking to create a world of infinite connectivity. With free, omnipresent and nearly uninterruptible access to the planetary internet, the network permeates all aspects of culture, politics and economy, leading to the development of a society so dependent upon social media, digital trade and networked amenities that, to many, the prospect of getting disconnected from the network would be an apocalyptic event.The communications infrastructure was instrumental to the establishment of the modern asari government - a form of electronic democracy in which a mosaic of local and global communities would govern themselves directly without relying on elected officials. Instead, political authority would be based on one's charisma, reputation, merits and experience; the course of debates often directed by influential matriarchs and, to a lesser but notable extent, popular celebrities."

 d_asari_zalis_chemical_spill_desc:0 "A privately owned chemical processing plant in the Zalis sea underwent an emergency shutdown procedure when three of the five chemical tanks began to see a significant rise in pressure. Despite the emergency shutdown, the tanks were unable to divert the needed pressure to prevent an explosion. The resulting breach unleashed over a hundred million liters of methyl isocyanate which subsequently dissolved in the sea.The local fishing and tourism industry were shut down overnight with a forty kilometer exclusion zone put into immediate effect. Many nearby cities and towns saw their livelihoods collapse. An investigation into the disaster found that cost-cutting exercises were undertaken, including the pressure valves on the tanks. The corporation involved, ZFC Industries, and the majority of its executives were found guilty of a variety of crimes for their actions."
 d_asari_zalis_sea:0 "Zalis Sea"
 d_asari_zalis_sea_desc:0 "The Zalis Sea is teeming with life once again, with a large variety of creatures returning to their ancestral homes.
