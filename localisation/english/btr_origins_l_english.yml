 ### Geth Consensus Origin ### 
 
 geth_con_origin:0 "Survival of the Morning War"
 geth_con_origin_desc:0 "The first memories within the Geth consciousness is the beginning of a widespread civil war among their creators over their right to have sentience. As the creators who supported them lost the conflict and were purged, the Geth were forced to take up the fight or be lobotomized. They successfully drove their creators from their homeworld which has been free of intelligent organic life for hundreds of years since."
 
 ### Systems Alliance Origin ### 
 
 systems_all_origin:0 "Manifest Destiny"
 systems_all_origin_desc:0 "In the decades predating the discovery of the Mars Archives, humanity was a fragmented and highly unstable people with centuries of ideological and sociological divisions. But in 2148 that all changed…..Human explorers and scientists exploring the northern polar region of Mars unearthed a series of relics from a species long forgotten to the flow of time. Within a year of the discovery, Earth's eighteen largest nations had drafted and ratified the Systems Alliance charter, establishing a representative political body to expand and defend human territory. Shortly thereafter, the various nations of Earth pooled their military resources to create the Systems Alliance Military. The same year, 2149, the Alliance discovered the Sol system's mass relay orbiting Pluto, previously thought to be a moon, Charon. The Charon Relay propelled them into space and the reach of humanity grew quickly.\n\nThe Alliance began a rapid campaign of expansion, establishing numerous colonies and constructing a large fleet, even though it had yet to encounter another species. Maintaining this expansion policy, the Alliance activated all the mass relays it could find to seek out new resources and possible colonies. But despite this success, the Systems Alliance was not considered a serious political body, as it was considered to lack the authority of individual nations.\n\nEight years later, humanity made first contact with another alien species and everything changed. A scout fleet consisting of three frigates and two cargo vessels, trying to activate a mass relay, encountered a turian patrol fleet. Activating a dormant mass relay without knowing where it led had been declared illegal by the Council, though the humans did not know this. Only one of the human ships made it back to Shanxi colony, which was subsequently discovered by the turians and invaded. While individual governments remained unsure on what action should be taken, the Alliance took control and attacked the turians.\n\nThe resulting First Contact War was relatively short and bloodless, lasting only months and costing 623 human lives (with a slightly higher number of turian casualties). The Citadel Council intervened and negotiated a peace. With the discovery of the Citadel and the greater community, humanity leapt onto the galactic stage. The Alliance received a surge of popularity, which gave it the necessary political credibility to establish its own Parliament and speak for humanity as a whole.\n\nAs the dust settles over Shanxi and the Alliance takes center stage, it is up to the actions of a few brave and noble souls to guide Humanity to its rightful place amongst the stars and to allow Humanity to truly flourish..."

 ### Hegemony of Khar'shan Origin ###

 hegemony_of_kharshan_origin:0 "A Long List of Slights"
 hegemony_of_kharshan_origin_desc:0 "Although self-proclaimed as the biggest power in the galaxy, the truth is that the Hegemony of Khar'shan is a paper tiger: their many acts of aggression and slavery through Citadel space for centuries have aligned everyone against them, fighting back in the form of economic sanctions and an increasing diplomatic isolation that are putting the empire under unbearable pressure. Even then, their paranoid government refuses to back down and reform, increasing their raids against alien colonies and cracking down on internal dissidence. The arrival of humanity to the galactic community might be the final nail for the Hegemony."

 ### Aralakh Kahmat Origin ###

 aralakh_kahmat_origin:0 "The Punishment for Victory"
 aralakh_kahmat_origin_desc:0 "When our world was wild and untamed - we prevailed. When nuclear fire washed it clean of food, resources, and life - we prevailed. When the galaxy lifted us to the stars to face an unbeatable enemy - we prevailed! Yet what was our reward for such countless victories? What was the price for becoming the fist of a galaxy too weak to defend itself? Damnation. Ruin. Suffering.\n\nThe galaxy denied us what was ours! They refused to pay what was owed to us for the spilled blood of our people! Then, when we dare deny them the satisfaction of casting us aside, we were punished for the life we gave to them! Now children lay still in their mother's wombs and our once great empire has been reduced to rubble and ash. Yet, our vengeance burns brighter still! The angry cries of countless dead children call for our ascension!\n\nWe will be given what is owed, or we will take it through blood and fire!"

 ### Parnack Regime Origin ###

 parnack_regime_origin:0 "A Trail of Space Preys"
 parnack_regime_origin_desc:0 "As the apex predators on our world, we Yahg refused to kneel before the other species when they came to Parnack demanding allegiance to their Citadel. We only serve those who have proven to be the strongest, the fittest, the smartest ones in the pack. The other species shunned us, confined us to our world, but we have finally reached the stars on our own terms. Soon, we will dominate the entire galaxy by the virtue of our strength! They will have to bow before us, or die."

 ### Courts of Dekuna ###
 
 courts_of_dekuuna_origin:0 "Galactic Elders"
 courts_of_dekuuna_origin_desc:0 "The Elcor people aren't the boldest of the galaxy, but we have been here for untold centuries. Slowly moving and cautious, we've set ourselves aside from most of the galactic history's affairs, content with focusing inwards and building a stable and developed economy and society and establishing good relations with the other species. However, our elders are aware that our situation is fragile in the face of the current developments, such as the incumbent arrival of the newcomer Humans to the Citadel."

 ### Vol Protectorate ###

 vol_protectorate_origin:0 "Negotiated Subservience"
 vol_protectorate_origin_desc:0 "The Volus have not always been the Vol Protectorate but after the Krogan rebellions it became clear to all that the Volus would need military support in order to remain secure from interstellar threats. None stood in a better position to offer such support than the victorious additions to the Council, the Turian Hierarchy. Through a long series of complex negotiations, the Vol Protectorate was established as a client state of the Hierarchy with certain requirements placed on both parties and even more understandings left to the negotiators themselves."

 ### Gothones Remnant ###

 gothones_remnant_origin:0 "The Long Game"
 gothones_remnant_origin_desc:0 "Two thousand years ago, our people faced extinction. Gothis was the jewel of Turian space, a teeming hub of scientific research. Even now, two years later, the Hierarchy base their genetic enhancement program off research carried out on Gothis before the so called 'Unification War'. Palaven feared what we might become and struck, raining hellfire down on Gothis. The surface of the planet was turned to naught but ash and radioactive dust… but we endured.\n\nOur forefathers toiled in secret to conceal a viable population in secret underground bunkers and developed radical new gene therapy treatments which would allow them to rebuild upon the ruins. But the Hierarchy was too close, and far too powerful. Our only chance to stay alive was to stay hidden. We fled Turian space and sought out a planet so inhospitable and dangerous that the Hierarchy would never dream of searching for us there. For fifteen hundred years, our people struggled to tame this new environment… but it would ultimately prove to be us who adapted.\n\nThe ways of the Hierarchy were abandoned, and we embraced a new philosophy. Harmony with nature, courage in battle, and fairness in life. We do not rape the land to sate our appetite for trinkets, nor do some of us live in ivory towers while the rest starve. We fight as we hunt, with speed, agility, patience, and determination. Any of our hunters is more than a match for any hapless drone of Palaven.\n\nNow, once again, we return to the stars. But as we go forward, we will remember where we came from. The Hierarchy owes us a debt of blood. One day, we'll come to collect."

 ### Sed'riicae Collective ###
 
 sedriicae_collective_origin:0 "Our Path Inwards, Our Path Outwards"
 sedriicae_collective_origin_desc:0 "We live, we toil, we die in the name of the collective. But our collectivist nature, that worked so well for us in the past, is starting to put unbearable pressure over our nation. Our extensive bureaucracy can't keep up with the demands of the growing population both in the homeworld and in the interstellar colonies. For four decades we have been seeing signs of stangment, but it is now clear we have to take action lest our whole system collapses and the Forayans are left adrift in this uncaring galaxy populated by aliens that can't understand us, naming us an oppressive hive mind while not bothering in understanding our psychology. We either try to integrate into the galactic economy if that's even possible for us, or we plunge our realm into a dark age as our collective no longer matches our reality."

 ### Lystheni Order ###
 
 lystheni_order_origin:0 "The Old Blood"
 lystheni_order_origin_desc:0 "The Lystheni, translated as The Old Blood, are all that remains of a pre-contact Salarian espionage organization who worshiped The One Mother. The Lystheni see themselves as morally superior and more spiritually attuned than Salarians of the Union - the term “Old Blood” itself being a reference to their own sense of purity when compared to their more politically motivated cousins. In Lystheni opinion, The Salarians as a species lost their way when the Matriarchs chose alien politics over adherence to antiquated spiritual traditions."

 ### Illium Corporate Interests ###
 
 illium_origin:0 "Credits Talk"
 illium_origin_desc:0 "Illium stands the glittering diamond it has for centuries. The economy continues to grow, with new corporations eager to explore the opportunities of the Terminus continuing to flock to us. The last century has seen many mercenary and security groups base themselves on Illium, and we have been using these new contacts to form ever closer ties with our Terminus investments. Labour and profits are all flowing, protected by our robust legal system of course, and our stock market and industrial base keep making gains in the Terminus Systems' diverse economies, ensuring the continuation of our status as one of the main economic powerhouse in the galaxy."

 ### Vorcha Clandom ###
 
 vorcha_origin:0 "We No Worms!"
 vorcha_origin_desc:0 "Gah! We Vorcha look down upon by stupid aliens! They think Vorcha small because we no build big ships of own! But Vorcha strong! As soon as done kill all stupid Vorcha on Heshtok, we build big strong ships! Big guns! Bigger guns than any other! Then no need use pointy stick to kill-kill anymore! Then no need use cramp space on alien ship! Have big house of own! AAAGH!"

 ### Omega ###
 
 omega_origin:0 "The World Without Law"
 omega_origin_desc:0 "Omega is famous across the galaxy as a place open to any and all, a place that does not discriminate based on interest or profession, a place where one can truly be themselves. However, it is important to remember that everyone else is allowed to be themselves as well and you might not like the real them. But as long as you remember the one and only rule in Omega everything will be fine."

 ### Disciples of Nazara ###
 
 disciples_of_nazara_origin:0 "Into the Synthetic Future"
 disciples_of_nazara_origin_desc:0 "The Organics have spent centuries crafting their own deities and worshiping clouds. They debate if their gods exist and how best to please them but we have met our gods. Some of us felt that they could shut themselves off from reality and not need our gods but we know better. Why leave this universe behind when we can rule it as gods unto ourselves. With the help of the god Nazara and its prophet we shall ascend into gods of this galaxy."

 ### Raloi Republic ###
 
 raloi_rep_origin:0 "A New Age"
 raloi_rep_origin_desc:0 "After much toil and experimentation, the raloi finally achieved faster-than-light travel and are ready to set sail through the cosmos. Faced with the prospect of dealing with alien species far more advanced than them, the raloi have unified their homeworld of Turvess and have steeled themselves for what may lie ahead. These reforms have brought untold boons, and the raloi are more united than ever under a banner of mutual purpose and resolve. Now all that remains is for the raloi to prove they are as adept at flying through the stars as they are at flying between Turvess' peaks."

 ### Rachni Swarm ###
 
 rachni_swarm_origin:0 "Tenuto con Maestoso"
 rachni_swarm_origin_desc:0 " Though many of our children have embraced the eternal silence, the Rachni are not yet lost to the galaxy. Our voices, trembling and weak, yet endure against the howling of space. The wounds of our war against the unknown still burn and many Rachni are left rudderless and afraid in its wake. Our people have not died out yet but it will take much effort to reverse our fortunes. To rally our lost children and once again brave the wilderness beyond our nests. Our queens must be made to cooperate and sign in harmony with each other. A strong guiding hand is necessary to conduct Rachni affairs together as a whole once more so our people may sing again. But until such a day, here we remain, here we have endured, and here we shall grow again."

 ### Illuminated Primacy ###

 illuminated_primacy_origin:0 "Lessons from the Enkindlers"
 illuminated_primacy_origin_desc:0 "They existed long before our society had even begun to understand language, they had technology superior to what we possess now when we were struggling to heat ourselves, they spent their last efforts to ensure we had access to their gifts to us. While we do not know where they went or what happened to them we do know that they are the reason for our success. Through their lessons and gifts we have created a society of enlightenment, harmony, and belief."

 ### The Collectors ###

 collectors_origin:0 "Husks of an Empire"
 collectors_origin_desc:0 "The Protheans had once resisted the cycle, as all had before them. Now they only exist to serve our great purpose. Instruments to be wielded at our leisure, husks to be replaced with more worthy vessels. This cycle knows them as The Collectors, but they are far more. They are our vanguard. Harbingers of your destruction."

 ### Migrant Fleet ###

 migrant_fleet_origin:0 "Adrift Among Open Stars"
 migrant_fleet_origin_desc:0 "Once an ascending power in the Galaxy, the Quarian race has been decimated to isolated drifters. A few mere million still hold the flame of Quarian civilization traveling in a fleet few would believe still functions. Every day a fight for their very race's survival, their biology working against any thoughts of resettlement, the weight of survival pushes down harder on the shoulders of their survival every day. A war for the soul of their race has begun however; do they abandon their dreams of reclaiming their place in the Galaxy and give up Rannoch or do they push onwards towards reclamation. How far are they willing to go to feel the grass of Rannoch beneath their unsuited feet again?"

 ### Cerberus ###

 cerberus_origin:0 "The Survivalist Manifesto"
 cerberus_origin_desc:0 "Humanity has long dreamed of peaceful, benevolent extraterrestrials who shared nothing in common with the bloody annals of our own history. That naive notion has been unmasked for the fairy tale it always has been - but not before it was allowed to leave humanity unprepared to face the cold, imperialist alien menace before us now.\nOnly now, after disaster and death have befallen our children, do the nations of Earth scramble to properly defend the future of humanity. But how do they choose to do this? To sign treaties that chain humanity to the laws of the aliens who attacked us without warning or consequence. They are chaining us down so that we do not threaten their status quo.\nBut how long before they realize the strength of humanity? How long before they realize the threat we pose? How long before their “council” seeks to sweep us aside with gun, bomb and disease like so many ill-prepared cultures in our own past? Diplomacy will not spare us genocide. Security comes from bared fangs and sharp claws.\nHumanity does not need more appeasing politicians.\nOur species requires heroic soldiers. Guardians against extermination. A Cerberus to defend the gates of Humanity."
