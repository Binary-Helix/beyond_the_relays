 ### Asari Republic Origin ###
 origin_asarep:0 "The First Among the Stars"
 origin_asarep_desc:0 "From the very beginning when Asari discovered the Citadel, the Republics served as the diplomatic arm and de facto leaders of the Citadel Space community, leading through thick and thin. However, as the crisis looms on the horizon, can their indecisive E-Democracy survive the incoming storm, and lead the galaxy towards peace and stability once more, or will they get left behind, unable to adapt to the rapid shock the galaxy is about to experience?"

 ### Salarian Union Origin ###
 salarian_uni_origin:0 "We Would be Legends"
 salarian_uni_origin_desc:0 "Knowledge is not only power, but the sword to which the Salarian Union puts its enemies. Despite being the co-founding race of the Citadel Council, the Salarians have the third-weakest economy in Citadel Space and an undersized fleet to match, but only fools see this as a sign of Salarian weakness. A labyrinthine bureaucracy and a web of intelligence services veil The Union in an impenetrable shadow of secrecy, out from which their all-seeing eyes peer into the galaxy."


 ### Turian Hierarchy Origin ###
 origin_turhie:0 "Blood on the Whetstone"
 origin_turhie_desc:0 "The Turian Hierarchy was forged and tempered in the fires of war. Their martial, disciplined nature lends itself to a highly militarized society, capable of taking on the burden of galactic security. Turian forces fought on the frontlines of the Krogan Rebellions, and have led every major Council peacekeeping operation since. The security and prosperity the Council Races now enjoy is largely backed by Turian firepower - pirates and Terminus warlords know better than to operate where the Turian Navy can reach them."
  
 ### Systems Alliance Origin ### 
 
 systems_all_origin:0 "Manifest Destiny"
 systems_all_origin_desc:0 "In the decades predating the discovery of the Mars Archives, humanity was a fragmented and highly unstable people with centuries of ideological and sociological divisions. But in 2148 that all changed…..Human explorers and scientists exploring the northern polar region of Mars unearthed a series of relics from a species long forgotten to the flow of time. Within a year of the discovery, Earth's eighteen largest nations had drafted and ratified the Systems Alliance charter, establishing a representative political body to expand and defend human territory. Shortly thereafter, the various nations of Earth pooled their military resources to create the Systems Alliance Military. The same year, 2149, the Alliance discovered the Sol system's mass relay orbiting Pluto, previously thought to be a moon, Charon. The Charon Relay propelled them into space and the reach of humanity grew quickly.\n\nThe Alliance began a rapid campaign of expansion, establishing numerous colonies and constructing a large fleet, even though it had yet to encounter another species. Maintaining this expansion policy, the Alliance activated all the mass relays it could find to seek out new resources and possible colonies. But despite this success, the Systems Alliance was not considered a serious political body, as it was considered to lack the authority of individual nations.\n\nEight years later, humanity made first contact with another alien species and everything changed. A scout fleet consisting of three frigates and two cargo vessels, trying to activate a mass relay, encountered a turian patrol fleet. Activating a dormant mass relay without knowing where it led had been declared illegal by the Council, though the humans did not know this. Only one of the human ships made it back to Shanxi colony, which was subsequently discovered by the turians and invaded. While individual governments remained unsure on what action should be taken, the Alliance took control and attacked the turians.\n\nThe resulting First Contact War was relatively short and bloodless, lasting only months and costing 623 human lives (with a slightly higher number of turian casualties). The Citadel Council intervened and negotiated a peace. With the discovery of the Citadel and the greater community, humanity leapt onto the galactic stage. The Alliance received a surge of popularity, which gave it the necessary political credibility to establish its own Parliament and speak for humanity as a whole.\n\nAs the dust settles over Shanxi and the Alliance takes center stage, it is up to the actions of a few brave and noble souls to guide Humanity to its rightful place amongst the stars and to allow Humanity to truly flourish..."

 ### Courts of Dekuna ###
 
 courts_of_dekuuna_origin:0 "Galactic Elders"
 courts_of_dekuuna_origin_desc:0 "The Elcor people aren't the boldest of the galaxy, but we have been here for untold centuries. Slowly moving and cautious, we've set ourselves aside from most of the galactic history's affairs, content with focusing inwards and building a stable and developed economy and society and establishing good relations with the other species. However, our elders are aware that our situation is fragile in the face of the current developments, such as the incumbent arrival of the newcomer Humans to the Citadel."

 ### Vol Protectorate ###

 vol_protectorate_origin:0 "Negotiated Subservience"
 vol_protectorate_origin_desc:0 "The Volus have not always been the Vol Protectorate but after the Krogan rebellions it became clear to all that the Volus would need military support in order to remain secure from interstellar threats. None stood in a better position to offer such support than the victorious additions to the Council, the Turian Hierarchy. Through a long series of complex negotiations, the Vol Protectorate was established as a client state of the Hierarchy with certain requirements placed on both parties and even more understandings left to the negotiators themselves."

 ### Illuminated Primacy ###

 illuminated_primacy_origin:0 "Lessons from the Enkindlers"
 illuminated_primacy_origin_desc:0 "They existed long before our society had even begun to understand language, they had technology superior to what we possess now when we were struggling to heat ourselves, they spent their last efforts to ensure we had access to their gifts to us. While we do not know where they went or what happened to them we do know that they are the reason for our success. Through their lessons and gifts we have created a society of enlightenment, harmony, and belief."

 ### Hegemony of Khar'shan Origin ###

 hegemony_of_kharshan_origin:0 "A Long List of Slights"
 hegemony_of_kharshan_origin_desc:0 "Although self-proclaimed as the biggest power in the galaxy, the truth is that the Hegemony of Khar'shan is a paper tiger: their many acts of aggression and slavery through Citadel space for centuries have aligned everyone against them, fighting back in the form of economic sanctions and an increasing diplomatic isolation that are putting the empire under unbearable pressure. Even then, their paranoid government refuses to back down and reform, increasing their raids against alien colonies and cracking down on internal dissidence. The arrival of humanity to the galactic community might be the final nail for the Hegemony."

 ### Aralakh Kahmat Origin ###

 aralakh_kahmat_origin:0 "The Punishment for Victory"
 aralakh_kahmat_origin_desc:0 "When our world was wild and untamed - we prevailed. When nuclear fire washed it clean of food, resources, and life - we prevailed. When the galaxy lifted us to the stars to face an unbeatable enemy - we prevailed! Yet what was our reward for such countless victories? What was the price for becoming the fist of a galaxy too weak to defend itself? Damnation. Ruin. Suffering.\n\nThe galaxy denied us what was ours! They refused to pay what was owed to us for the spilled blood of our people! Then, when we dare deny them the satisfaction of casting us aside, we were punished for the life we gave to them! Now children lay still in their mother's wombs and our once great empire has been reduced to rubble and ash. Yet, our vengeance burns brighter still! The angry cries of countless dead children call for our ascension!\n\nWe will be given what is owed, or we will take it through blood and fire!"

 ### Migrant Fleet Origin ###

 migrant_fleet_origin:0 "Adrift Among Open Stars"
 migrant_fleet_origin_desc:0 "Once an ascending power in the Galaxy, the Quarian race has been decimated to isolated drifters. A few mere million still hold the flame of Quarian civilization traveling in a fleet few would believe still functions. Every day a fight for their very race's survival, their biology working against any thoughts of resettlement, the weight of survival pushes down harder on the shoulders of their survival every day. A war for the soul of their race has begun however; do they abandon their dreams of reclaiming their place in the Galaxy and give up Rannoch or do they push onwards towards reclamation. How far are they willing to go to feel the grass of Rannoch beneath their unsuited feet again?"

 ### Cerberus ###

 cerberus_origin:0 "The Survivalist Manifesto"
 cerberus_origin_desc:0 "Humanity has long dreamed of peaceful, benevolent extraterrestrials who shared nothing in common with the bloody annals of our own history. That naive notion has been unmasked for the fairy tale it always has been - but not before it was allowed to leave humanity unprepared to face the cold, imperialist alien menace before us now.\nOnly now, after disaster and death have befallen our children, do the nations of Earth scramble to properly defend the future of humanity. But how do they choose to do this? To sign treaties that chain humanity to the laws of the aliens who attacked us without warning or consequence. They are chaining us down so that we do not threaten their status quo.\nBut how long before they realize the strength of humanity? How long before they realize the threat we pose? How long before their “council” seeks to sweep us aside with gun, bomb and disease like so many ill-prepared cultures in our own past? Diplomacy will not spare us genocide. Security comes from bared fangs and sharp claws.\nHumanity does not need more appeasing politicians.\nOur species requires heroic soldiers. Guardians against extermination. A Cerberus to defend the gates of Humanity."

 omega_origin_desc:0 "Omega is famous across the galaxy as a place open to any and all, a place that does not discriminate based on interest or profession, a place where one can truly be themselves. However, it is important to remember that everyone else is allowed to be themselves as well and you might not like the real them. But as long as you remember the one and only rule in Omega everything will be fine."

 ### Illium Corporate Interests ###
 
 illium_origin:0 "Credits Talk"
 illium_origin_desc:0 "Illium stands the glittering diamond it has for centuries. The economy continues to grow, with new corporations eager to explore the opportunities of the Terminus continuing to flock to us. The last century has seen many mercenary and security groups base themselves on Illium, and we have been using these new contacts to form ever closer ties with our Terminus investments. Labour and profits are all flowing, protected by our robust legal system of course, and our stock market and industrial base keep making gains in the Terminus Systems' diverse economies, ensuring the continuation of our status as one of the main economic powerhouse in the galaxy."

 #Remnants of Rakhana ###
 remnants_of_rakhana_origin:0 "A Distant Shore of Infinite Spirit"
 remnants_of_rakhana_origin_desc:0 "In ancient times, our scientists had believed that we were the center of the Universe. That our sun orbited us and the stars were fixed. We learned better, and grew greedy in our desire to break our old beliefs and embrace the power of the universe. Our desire outpaced the means of our planet. It has been untold years since the ships came from the sky and evacuated some of our number. Yet many still remain - ruthless and hardended by war over what meager lives we can scavenge, laying witness to the punishment for our arrogance. There is only a single law to govern us now: survive, by any means. But there are still those who refuse that all is lost, those that dream of a salvation. Perhaps this is but another test of Kalahira."

 START_SCREEN_DOOMSDAY:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] is dying. In their arrogance, our ancestors stripped the surface of its resources and pumped toxic fumes into the sky to support their bloated way of life. In this they have doomed us all. Acid rain falls from the sky, the rivers have turned to toxic streams that feed a poisionous ocean. [Root.GetScientistPlural] has confirmed that after centuries of such conditions, the planet's unstable weather will have killed the last viable soil and resources will be too scarce to support a population of any size. \n\nThe time to reverse our destiny is long over, our only hope is to find a new home. [Root.Capital.GetName] must be left behind and we must seek refuge elsewhere amongst the stars. While the shortsighted and scared will war themselves to death, the hopeful among us will strive to bring what remains of our people to a distant planet - just as the Hanar had done for our people long ago. \n\nMay Kalahira guide our unworthy hands."

 sedriicae_collective_origin_desc:0 "We live, we toil, we die in the name of the collective. But our collectivist nature, that worked so well for us in the past, is starting to put unbearable pressure over our nation. Our extensive bureaucracy can't keep up with the demands of the growing population both in the homeworld and in the interstellar colonies. For four decades we have been seeing signs of stangment, but it is now clear we have to take action lest our whole system collapses and the Forayans are left adrift in this uncaring galaxy populated by aliens that can't understand us, naming us an oppressive hive mind while not bothering in understanding our psychology. We either try to integrate into the galactic economy if that's even possible for us, or we plunge our realm into a dark age as our collective no longer matches our reality."

 lystheni_order_origin_desc:0 "The Lystheni, translated as The Old Blood, are all that remains of a pre-contact Salarian espionage organization who worshiped The One Mother. The Lystheni see themselves as morally superior and more spiritually attuned than Salarians of the Union - the term “Old Blood” itself being a reference to their own sense of purity when compared to their more politically motivated cousins. In Lystheni opinion, The Salarians as a species lost their way when the Matriarchs chose alien politics over adherence to antiquated spiritual traditions."

 ### Gothones Remnant ###

 gothones_remnant_origin:0 "The Long Game"
 gothones_remnant_origin_desc:0 "Two thousand years ago, our people faced extinction. Gothis was the jewel of Turian space, a teeming hub of scientific research. Even now, two years later, the Hierarchy base their genetic enhancement program off research carried out on Gothis before the so called 'Unification War'. Palaven feared what we might become and struck, raining hellfire down on Gothis. The surface of the planet was turned to naught but ash and radioactive dust… but we endured.\n\nOur forefathers toiled in secret to conceal a viable population in secret underground bunkers and developed radical new gene therapy treatments which would allow them to rebuild upon the ruins. But the Hierarchy was too close, and far too powerful. Our only chance to stay alive was to stay hidden. We fled Turian space and sought out a planet so inhospitable and dangerous that the Hierarchy would never dream of searching for us there. For fifteen hundred years, our people struggled to tame this new environment… but it would ultimately prove to be us who adapted.\n\nThe ways of the Hierarchy were abandoned, and we embraced a new philosophy. Harmony with nature, courage in battle, and fairness in life. We do not rape the land to sate our appetite for trinkets, nor do some of us live in ivory towers while the rest starve. We fight as we hunt, with speed, agility, patience, and determination. Any of our hunters is more than a match for any hapless drone of Palaven.\n\nNow, once again, we return to the stars. But as we go forward, we will remember where we came from. The Hierarchy owes us a debt of blood. One day, we'll come to collect."

These reforms have brought untold boons, and the raloi are more united than ever under a banner of mutual purpose and resolve. Now all that remains is for the raloi to prove they are as adept at flying through the stars as they are at flying between Turvess' peaks."

Our people have not died out yet but it will take much effort to reverse our fortunes. To rally our lost children and once again brave the wilderness beyond our nests.
