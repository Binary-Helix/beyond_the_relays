 drell_origin_doomsday:0 "A Distant Shore of Infinite Spirit"
 drell_origin_doomsday_desc:0 "In ancient times, our scientists had believed that we were the center of the Universe. That our sun orbited us and the stars were fixed. We learned better, and grew greedy in our desire to break our old beliefs and embrace the power of the universe. Our desire outpaced the means of our planet. It has been untold years since the ships came from the sky and evacuated some of our number. Yet many still remain - ruthless and hardended by war over what meager lives we can scavenge, laying witness to the punishment for our arrogance. There is only a single law to govern us now: survive, by any means. But there are still those who refuse that all is lost, those that dream of a salvation. Perhaps this is but another test of Kalahira."
 drell_origin_tooltip_doomsday_effects:2 "§R- WARNING: Challenging Origin§!\n- Rakhana faces the end of a slow death, in §H35 to 45 years§! after the game starts it will be unable to sustain life. If the Drell are to survive they must find a new home."
 START_SCREEN_DOOMSDAY:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] is dying. In their arrogance, our ancestors stripped the surface of its resources and pumped toxic fumes into the sky to support their bloated way of life. In this they have doomed us all. Acid rain falls from the sky, the rivers have turned to toxic streams that feed a poisionous ocean. [Root.GetScientistPlural] has confirmed that after centuries of such conditions, the planet's unstable weather will have killed the last viable soil and resources will be too scarce to support a population of any size. \n\nThe time to reverse our destiny is long over, our only hope is to find a new home. [Root.Capital.GetName] must be left behind and we must seek refuge elsewhere amongst the stars. While the shortsighted and scared will war themselves to death, the hopeful among us will strive to bring what remains of our people to a distant planet - just as the Hanar had done for our people long ago. \n\nMay Kalahira guide our unworthy hands."

 drell_origin.61.name:0 "The End is Nigh"
 drell_origin.61.desc:1 "Violent storms, mass wildlife extinctions and tectonic instability on [Root.GetName] continue to increase at alarming speed. Our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] have calculated a rough timeline of when the planet will become completely unlivable:\n\nThey estimate that we have between §H35 to 45 years§! until the planet's resources and weather are unable to support life anylonger.\n\nConditions on the surface will steadily deteriorate until then."
 drell_origin_61.a:0 "There is not much time."
 drell_origin.65.name:0 "Conditions Worsen on [Root.GetName]"
 drell_origin.65.desc:1 "The sun disappears behind an oily black sky across most of [Root.GetName], most are lucky to get a few hours of sun between the days of acid rain and violent winds produced by these massive, pollutant fueled storms. Air travel is nearly impossible and offworld communications are uselessly unstable if conducted from the planet's surface. Temperatures have dropped by several degrees and most of what clean drinking water was left has been soiled.\n\nDespite all this, few on Rakhana seem to even care. Bandits still storm survivor camps and there was even a short nuclear exchange between two warlords. The outlook is dim, but we must endure."
 drell_origin_65.a:0 "Things will only get worse."
 drell_origin.70.name:0 "End Times Approach"
 drell_origin.70.desc:1 "The storms have only gotten worse, some areas of [Root.GetName] have not seen sunlight in months, if they are lucky enough to have survived the lakes of standing, toxic water. Already 98% of wildlife on the planet has been taken by the latest die-off and only small, indoor hydropaunics farms are still viable.\n\nWarlords and bandits have long since stopped caring about survival, they kill and worse for the fun of it now. Refugees from careless nuclear detonations and mass executions travel the desert only to die. The good news is that this has turned many to our cause...time is running short, but there is still hope. For now."




 drell_origin.75.name:0 "Dying Gasp"
 drell_origin.75.desc:1 "Conditions on [Root.GetName] are at a tipping point. The storms of acid rain and pollution have subsided, only to reveal a greatly deterriated ozone layer hiding above it. The sun is unbearable and going out during the day without advanced equipment is suicidal. Most of the remaining population are clustered within rundown mines, metros or bombshelters to escape the scorching heat of the surface. What cities do remain standing are little more than forts manned by warlords living out their last days doing unthinkable cruelties. But even these last few bastions will not survive for long. Hopeful estimates say that there is enough food for one family for every 1,000 Drell in any given area. Most the time there isn't even that much. Many choose to take their own lives than die of starvation. \n\nWith earthquakes and dried up rivers comes uncovered resources, they aren't much but they can be worked by whatever functional industry still remains."
 drell_origin_75.a:0 "The end is near."
 drell_origin.76.name:0 "Final Moments"
 drell_origin.76.desc:0 "It will not be long now. [Root.GetName]'s food supplies have run out and most estimates predict that the last wildlife died off months ago. Our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] predict that the end will come in less than a year.\n\nVery little time remains for the poor souls still trapped on the planet's surface..."

 drell_origin.80.intro.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has been rendered lifeless, putting the tormented population out of its misery. No wildlife survives on the surface and the radiation from the daytime sun alone is enough to kill most breathing creatures in short order. All that remains are the husks of our former cities and a cracked, broken surface. There is no salvation from one's own sins."
 drell_origin.80.1:0 "Unfortunately, not all of our citizens were evacuated from the surface, we pray that their suffering was shortlived.\n\nBut now, is the time to look towards the future. As we rebuild, we will do so in their names and with their memory so perfectly preserved within us."
 drell_origin.80.2:0 "In what can only be described as an utter tragedy, we failed to evacuate most of the planet. Untold numbers watched as the last shuttle breached orbit, themselves doomed to starve, be killed or take their own lives.\n\nStill, we must carry on. The surviving [doomsday_owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] in the galaxy can now only look to the future in the hope that it will bring something better than the horrors of the past."
 drell_origin.80.3:0 "As horribel as it was to witness its end, we can rest easy in the knowledge that the entire planet was successfully evacuated - a monumental achievement in itself.\n\nIt is now time to rebuild that which was lost. If adversity brings strength, then surely the trials we endured have made us stronger."
 drell_origin.80.4:0 "In the end, the weight of our sins was too great and our feet were stayed as our chance at rapture slipped away. The Drell left behind the Hanar have failed to save themselves, much as they always have. We die, huddled in circles on a dead world. \n\nAnd so it was that the [doomsday_owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] became just another tragic footnote in galactic history."

 drell_origin.85.1.desc:0 "As the first colonists arrive on the surface of §H[Root.GetName]§!, many are overcome with a sense of euphoria. Worlds other than [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] that are capable of supporting [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] life were known to exist since the arrival of the Hanar, but what if they were exceedingly rare? What if they had already been claimed by others?\n\nThose fears can be put to rest now - [Root.GetName] is a [Root.GetPlanetMoon] where [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] can thrive. These fortunate groups of initial colonists are a start, but countless [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are still trapped on our doomed homeworld."
 drell_origin.85.2.desc:0 "§H[Root.GetName]§! is a bleak and unpleasant world by [Root.OWner.GetSpeciesName] standards, but it does have one significant advantage over [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] - it is not about die.\n\nThis is a struggle for survival, and if that means that [Root.GetName] is to be our new home, then so be it. It shall serve as a safe haven, at the very least until better planetary candidates are found. Despite the harsh conditions on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, the colonists are the lucky ones. Countless [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are still trapped on our doomed homeworld."
