Due to how the static empire has to be coded, ME:BTR currently does not support custom empires or edits of the ME:BTR Empires. \n\nContinuing will almost certainly break multiple aspects of the mod, lead to balance issues, potential instability, and break many events and other unforeseen problems. It will also prevent the spawning of one or more ME:BTR empires. This will stop you from getting the intended experience. It is HIGHLY recommended that you exit to the main menu and select one of the official prescripted empires.\n\nYou have been warned!§"
