 relic_asarep_temple_athame_desc:0 "An important religious place and a popular tourist destination in Thessia on the surface, the Temple of Athame is more than meets the eye as it houses the greatest secret and crime of the Asari Republics, known only to the select few matriarchs. A massive Prothean archive sits below the temple, being studied day and night by the brightest minds. Although it has been many centuries since any major discovery, this artifact has nonetheless provided that extra technological edge, and many believe that all its secrets are yet to be revealed."

 btr_r_salarian_uni_ghost_ship_desc:0 "Over our colony of Saetabelo a mysterious ship suddenly appeared. Our sensors almost immediately recognized the intrusive presence of AI aboard, and it was almost obliterated. Luckily it was not, for as it turns out the ship is the remnant of a civilization whose physical forms were wiped out by a supernova. They saved themselves from destruction, and the pain of physical existence, by uploading their minds into a virtual world, cared for by an advanced AI. Diplomacy has been opened, and their secrets have unlocked new possibilities."

 btr_r_salarian_uni_mannovai_artifacts_desc:0 "Great pride was taken in the colony of Mannovai and to celebrate its founding paintings, sculptures and works of literary art were commissioned within the year and any medallions from League of One members who died defending the colony were preserved on the planet. These commissioned pieces of art, along with medallions of killed League of One operatives, were “saved” by an Asari professor during a Batarian raid and are now kept at the Asari University of Serrice.  The periodic prodding and protest of our citizens should see them returned to Salarian hands over time."
