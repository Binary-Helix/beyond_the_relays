 systems_all_skyllian_verge_desc:0 "If humanity wasn't meant to lead, then why are we here now? There is such a thing as the winds of nature, of history, and whenever those winds swept humanity into its gale we have risen to the challenge! War, plague and industrial carelessness have attempted to end us in the past and yet we prevailed! Why? Because humanity has always been destined for the stars! Our future is out there waiting for us and we'd be fools to expect it handed to us! The new frontier is before us and, just like every challenge of our past, we will overcome it!"
