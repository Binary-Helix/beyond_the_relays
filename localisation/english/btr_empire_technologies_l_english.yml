 tech_turian_fleet_in_being:0 "Fleet in Being Doctrine"
 tech_turian_fleet_in_being_desc:0 "The Turian Navy is the guarantor of peace and security in council space, and our most important bargaining chip in galactic affairs. If the fleet loses its primacy, so too does the Hierarchy."
 tech_turian_planetary_kasrs:0 "Planetary Kasrs"
 tech_turian_planetary_kasrs_desc:0 "Mobilization for galactic emergencies must be facilitated by pre-existing infrastructure. The Kasrs are that infrastructure."

 ### Systems Alliance
 tech_systems_all_exogeni:0 "ExoGeni Private Colony Endeavors"
 tech_systems_all_exogeni_desc:0 "ExoGeni Corporation is humanity's corporate leader in planetary exploration and colonization.

 tech_volus_protective_suits_desc:0 "Our protective suits have become the image of our species in the minds of every other race in the milky way. The highly customizable nature of these suits allows them to fulfill a plethora of roles while also allowing us to travel beyond the limited number of habitable worlds available to us."
 tech_volus_government_structures:0 "Adaptive Government Structures"
 tech_volus_government_structures_desc:0 "One of the most confusing aspects of the Volus society to outsiders is its government. Instead of the rigid and ever present institutions, processes, and organizations that most other species use to govern themselves, the Volus use a highly fluid government system. The concept of “departments” or “agencies” is alien to the Volus, replaced with decentralized organizations that eb and flow along with the task that they perform. In some cases, government organizations exist without any relation to one another except for the fact that they have received authority to regulate some aspect of society."

 #Illuminated Primacy
 tech_hanar_gravity_drives:0 "Contra-Gravity Drives"
 tech_hanar_gravity_drives_desc:0 "Mass Effect powered devices that are used to repel gravity and allow users to levitate. They are extremely small and nearly invisible to the naked eye but can be scaled up for more industrial processes."
 tech_hanar_genemodding:0 "Foundational Genemodding"
 tech_hanar_genemodding_desc:0 "We have possibly the most experience out of all the species in the Milky Way with Gene editing. This is the legacy of our generous rescuing of the Drell from their dying homeworld. Their species could not be worse suited to live on the worlds that we inhabit so large amounts of effort have been dedicated to attempts at better adjusting them to life on our worlds. While this hasn't made our worlds paradise to them, it has allowed them an unprecedented amount of integration within Hanar society."

 #Hegemony of Kar'shan
 tech_batarian_gulags:0 "Low-G Gulags"
 tech_batarian_gulags_desc:0 "Disregard for forced workers and slaves' lives makes way for reduced production costs thanks to the lack of mass effect field generators to compensate for the low/null gravity."
 tech_batarian_implants:0 "Slave Control Implants"
 tech_batarian_implants_desc:0 "Slaves abducted from raided alien colonies are implanted with these devices to control them and ensure they work until exhaustion without being able to even think about rebelling against their masters."
 tech_batarian_state_arms:0 "Batarian State Arms"
 tech_batarian_state_arms_desc:0 "Batarian State Arms is a military-controlled hardware manufacturing company. The batarian government does not trust private industry to create their military hardware. BSA is a vast nationalised institution infamous for its waste and corruption. It produces all kinds of effective, if unethical, weaponry."

 #Aralakh Kahmat
 tech_krogan_sky_hammer_thrusters:0 "Sky Hammer Thrusters"

 tech_quarian_central_financial_administration:0 "Central Financial Administration VI Logic Algorithm Upgrades"
 tech_quarian_central_financial_administration_desc:0 "Since the loss of Rannoch the fleet's finances have been managed via a centralized body formed out of what resources remained after the Morning War. The administration controls the economy of the fleet, and uses a series of front companies to trade in Galactic Markets with the quiet use of VI boosters. While technically illegal, the small scale and Quarian ingenuity means it goes unnoticed."
 tech_quarian_suit_guild_weaves:0 "Suit Guild Weaves"
 tech_quarian_suit_guild_weaves_desc:0 "A Pilgrim recently brought a nanoweave technology that a Human laboratory was experimenting with. While our resource stockpiles leave it unsuitable for military application, the Suit Guild has expressed interest in adapting the technology to speed up suit production, allowing much quicker manufacturing of replacement suits for those in need."

 #Cerberus
 tech_cerberus_restricted_iff_codes:0 "Restricted IFF Codes"
 tech_cerberus_restricted_iff_codes_desc:0 "With Project Doorway, a world of possibilities has opened to us. By infiltrating restricted corporate and government records, we now have the ability to create seemingly legitimate IFFs at will - or erase entire systems from known space. We now hide in plain sight, vanishing our fleets and systems at will and having them appear elsewhere at whim."
 tech_cerberus_enhanced_defense_initiative:0 "Enhanced Defense Initiative"
 tech_cerberus_enhanced_defense_initiative_desc:0 "Perhaps The Alliance is too shortsighted to realize the potential they squander by refusing to advance the capabilities of virtual intelligence.

 #Omega
 tech_omega_unrestricted_knowledge:0 "Unrestricted Knowledge"
 tech_omega_unrestricted_knowledge_desc:0 "Regulating research is self defeating, we must allow our greatest minds to learn whatever they can about the world around them so that they can use these discoveries to our advantage."
 tech_omega_unrestricted_targeting_scanners:0 "Unrestricted Targeting Scannors"
 tech_omega_unrestricted_targeting_scanners_desc:0 "Omega is not known for its generosity and this extends to civilian casualties. Since there is no state, and there are no citizens the security forces are not interested in the safety of anyone in their way unless specifically ordered to care by their benefactors."

 #Illium Corporate Interests
 tech_illium_stock_market:0 "Interstellar Closed Economy Theory"
 tech_illium_stock_market_desc:0 "We have to establish Illium as the galaxy's central trade hub outside Citadel Council's jurisdiction, and for that to be possible we have to ensure the other independent worlds' dependency on us."
 tech_illium_shady_business_lines:0 "Shady Business Lines"
 tech_illium_shady_business_lines_desc:0 "The Terminus can be many things, but nice isn't one of them. We must regulate the information broker business, allowing them to operate in our territory in exchange for some privileged access to their files for the board of shareholders."
 tech_illium_bleeding_edge:0 "Bleeding Edge"
 tech_illium_bleeding_edge_desc:0 "If we are to have the upper hand on galactic trade we must ensure that our goods are of the utmost quality. For that we must heavily invest in R&D, lest we lag behind other major technological powerhouses."
 tech_illium_outsourced_law_enforcement:0 "Outsourced Law Enforcement"
 tech_illium_outsourced_law_enforcement_desc:0 "It's clear that the best way to ensure the procurement of public goods and services is handing over control of them to private enterprises.

 tech_illium_reinforced_arcologies:0 "Reinforced and Enlarged Arcologies"
 tech_illium_reinforced_arcologies_desc:0 "Illium is hot and massive; ground settlement is only possible at the higher polar latitudes. In more equatorial locations, the population is housed in arcology skyscrapers to escape the heat of the surface. We have to make sure our growing population can be accommodated inside those."
 
 #Caleston Directorate
 tech_caleston_dir_hazard_suit:0 "EAE-CA Hazard Suit"
 tech_caleston_dir_hazard_suit_desc:0 "Even with the extensive Dome infrastructure there are times that require expeditions into the wastelands of Caleston. This requires specialized equipment and now we have taken the step to creating our own specialized suits instead of buying generics from afar."
 tech_caleston_dir_eezo_refinement:0 "Advanced Eezo Refinement"
 tech_caleston_dir_eezo_refinement_desc:0 "Considering our society exists because of our planets abundant Element Zero it is no surprise that we invest significantly into ways to get more of out it. At long last we have developed a process to refine Element Zero with less waste and loss, with this we should be able to sell more and charge more."

 #Remnants of Rakhana
 tech_drell_rachati_blades:0 "Rachati Blades"
 tech_drell_rachati_blades_desc:0 "As firearms grew more and more rare, our race returned to the blade - a weapon we had taken pride in mastering in days gone. The discovery of a small but untouched supply of titanium has seen the finding of old, lighter designs which will allow for more high quality blades to be constructed by the Drell states, allowing warriors increased agility in a fight."
 tech_drell_endothermic_valve_rerouters:0 "Endothermic Valve Rerouters"
 tech_drell_endothermic_valve_rerouters_desc:0 "Necessity breeds innovation. Energy for our equipment is scarce in the wastes, with our equipment running dangerously close to running out of supplies at all times unless scavengers can keep supplies coming in.As such, one of the most vital developments of the post collapse was vehicle parts that could utilize the outside heat and use it to help reduce energy loss, making us more efficient."

 #Sed'riicae Collective
 tech_sedriicae_economic_policy:0 "New Economic Policy"
 tech_sedriicae_economic_policy_desc:0 "We can't overlook the fact that our centralised management style of economic governance has left us incapable of keeping up with changing circumstances and satisfying our population's demands beyond basic goods and services. Therefore, it's been decided to hire alien experts to help reduce our government's crushing responsibilities."
 tech_sedriicae_industry_modernization:0 "Industry Modernisation"
 tech_sedriicae_industry_modernization_desc:0 "As part of the task of renovating our economy, we must take a look at our industry.

 tech_lystheni_viral_warfare_strategem:0 "Viral Warfare Stratagem"
 tech_lystheni_viral_warfare_strategem_desc:0 "The goals of the Lystheni demand answers to heretical species, but their lack of resources makes more subtle strategies difficult. Instead, the Lystheni have sunk their time and resources into illegal, but effective, biological warfare."
 tech_lystheni_oracle_class_ai:0 "Oracle-Class Artificial Intelligence"
 tech_lystheni_oracle_class_ai_desc:0 "Our heretical cousins, and their leash masters on the Council, weaken themselves by disallowing themselves the use of infinitely powerful computing technology. We scoff in the face of their mortal laws and give birth to a new age of holy servant - A.I who will serve as oracles to our future victory by analyzing the quantum threads in space time."

 #Gothones Remnant
 tech_gothones_harmonious_husbandry:0 "Harmonious Husbandry"
 tech_gothones_harmonious_husbandry_desc:0 "Our people have mastered the art of training and domesticating animals of all shapes and sizes."

 tech_parnack_registry_of_alphas_desc:0 "With the new technological inventions we are able to store all recorded and oral information on the biggest alphas in our story. This 'Registry of Alphas' will serve at the same time as a political guide for our leaders, a historical treasure for our intellectuals and cultural entertainment and inspiration for our people."
 tech_parnack_standing_armies:0 "Standing Armies"
 tech_parnack_standing_armies_desc:0 "While our society is fractioned by packs by evolutionary instinct, progress and science are making social divisions based on packs less important by the day. Yahg are starting to see their whole species as one big pack, confronted by untold hostile aliens packs. In light of this, a standing, professional, non-tribal army is starting to look feasible as long as our people focus their inherent aggressiveness on other species."

 #Raloi Republic
 tech_raloi_foreign_advisors:0 "Foreign Advisors"

 tech_geth_sphere_phys:0 "Geth Sphere"
 tech_geth_sphere_phys_desc:0 "The Geth have long wished to be truly unified rather than operating based on the clumsy and inefficient linked system that they currently use. To this end they developed a megastructure that could allow them to all share thoughts and opinions at once without delay. The completion of such would see the Geth largely vanish from the galactic stage into a paradise of their own design."
 tech_geth_sphere_soc:0 "Geth Sphere Operational Coding"
 tech_geth_sphere_soc_desc:0 "The physical shell of our megastructure is only half of our collective dream. It is nothing but a metal ball without the ability of us to inhabit it and thrive within the virtual realm we create inside of it. That virtual existence will not create itself and we must create the most robust operating system in the galaxy in order to handle everything that we plan on creating."

 #Rachni Hive
