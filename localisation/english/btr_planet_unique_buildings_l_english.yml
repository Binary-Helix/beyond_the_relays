    ### DUNE ###
    building_ammos_aegis:0 "Ammos Aegis"
    building_ammos_aegis_desc:0 "A massive wall, more similar to a giant dam that wraps around until it connects with itself, this structure defends our most important settlements from the endless tides of sand and sand storms. It is expensive to construct and just as expensive to maintain but without it we most likely could not form urban centers on this world."

    ### DUST ###
    building_atmospheric_hydrator:0 "Atmospheric Hydrator"
    building_atmospheric_hydrator_desc:0 "This goliath spire juts out of the dead soil on the planet and appears to be covered in a perpetual fog at the top. However, that fog is actually the moisture being emitted into the atmosphere to help restart this planet's water cycle and bring life back to the ground below. With its help we will be able to start using the dirt for more than just a surface on which to plant buildings. It also puts us in near total control of the planets water cycle until enough water has been introduced for it to become self sustaining."

    ### BADLANDS ###
    building_roughneck_barracks:0 "Roughneck Barracks"
    building_roughneck_barracks_desc:0 "The rugged terrain of this planet makes standard governance difficult and breeds a more harder culture than that of our core worlds. Having a strong contingent of soldiers on hand and ready to move at a moments notice goes a long way toward asserting our authority and protecting the world from threats of all kind."

    ### AQUIFER ###
    building_groundwater_reclamation_complex:0 "Ground Water Reclaimation Complex"
    building_groundwater_reclamation_complex_desc:0 "This large complex and its subsidiary outposts pump an awe inspiring quantity of water from the seemingly endless seas underneath the planets surface. This water allows our citizens a nearly unlimited supply to with as they please."

    ### MESA ###
    building_urban_canyon:0 "Urban Canyon"
    building_urban_canyon_desc:0 "A planet covered in canyons, like veins spreading across the surface, would habitually be a difficult place to inhabit. Violent wildlife and extreme season shifts are proving hostile to our settlements. However, our engineers have devised a new habitat structure, built into the walls of the canyons, effectively using them both as a source of water and as cover from the sun and heat, saving us energy we'd otherwise invest in keeping temperatures stable."

    ### CENOTE ###
    building_sinkhole_mining_infrastructure:0 "Sinkhole Mining Infrastructure"
    building_sinkhole_mining_infrastructure_desc:0 "Tapping into the richest deposits down in the depths of the sinkholes dotting #name requires special regulations, training and equipment due to extreme hazards of such undertaking. All of these elements in place will ensure our miners can extract minerals safely and effectively."

    ### OUTBACK ###
    building_hydro_mining_station:0 "Hydro Mining Station"
    building_hydro_mining_station_desc:0 "Knowing that this planet has large amounts of water trapped beneath its surface we can begin prospecting for these pockets of water and then dig down to liberate the water for use by our settlers. Depending on where these pockets are located they may allow us to create settlements far into the otherwise uninhabitable desert regions."

    ### OASIS ###
    building_planetary_canal_system:0 "Planetary Canal System"
    building_planetary_canal_system_desc:0 "A system of canals that span the entire planet connecting the vast majority of the planetary oases. Potentially capable of being seen from nearby planets it brings life to what was previously uninhabitable stretches of the planets surfaces."

    ### STEPPE ###
    building_galactic_retreat:0 "Galactic Retreat"
    building_galactic_retreat_desc:0 "The vast calming meadows and grassy flatlands are considered extremely beautiful by many across the galaxy. If given the opportunity and the relevant infrastructure many would gladly travel to spend time enjoying this uncommonly serene planet."

    ### VELD ###
    building_ground_taming_operations:0 "Ground Taming Operations"
    building_ground_taming_operations_desc:0 "This planet has large stretches of untamed land that could become productive given a large enough investment. While it is unlikely that any individual could handle the cost of such an endeavor the government could easily find the resources to begin breaking the ground and removing the many large rock outcroppings. If we chose to undertake this program it would go a long way to reducing the planets reliance on expensive hydroponics for its food supply."

    ### MEDITERRANEAN ###
    building_aqueduct_system:0 "Aqueduct System"
    building_aqueduct_system_desc:0 "While the coastal areas of this planet are well suited to habitation the rest of the world is not. If we were able to bring water from the rainy, temperate regions to the arid interior it would open much more land to our settlers. Ideally this would be done automatically with as little upkeep as possible, our engineers believe that gravity is the best option if we can take advantage of it."

    ### RETINAL ###
    building_retinal_power_plant:0 "Retinal Power Plant"
    building_retinal_power_plant_desc:0 "The abundance of retinal reactive compounds on this planet provides us an opportunity to take advantage of a more powerful solar reaction that what we can artifically create. While this material requires very specific conditions that the planet has in abundance it does force us to isolate the power generation chambers from our crews as our pressence can be dangerous to the retinal compounds that we are employing. It also requires us to harvest large quantities of the retinal reactive material from the surrounding flora although our biologists are confident that this will not harm the ecosystem so long as we only take small samples from each plant."

    ### ATOLL ###
    building_island_hoppers:0 "Island Hoppers"
    building_island_hoppers_desc:0 "Situated in optimal positions on each island across the surface of the planet, these stations facilitate rapid and efficient travel back and forth. Nicknamed "Island Hoppers" by locals, this transit system utilizes a scaled down but still just as effective railgun style maglev system to propel trasnport capsules from one station to another in record time and with little waste."

    ### COASTAL ###
    building_luxury_resort:0 "Luxury Resort"
    building_luxury_resort_desc:0 "Much of our world is dedicated to the production of the vital necessities needed to maintain the habitability and relative self-sufficiency of our colony. However, our people deserve to relax and enjoy the liberties that our empire has to offer, and what better way to do that than to offer a luxurious stay at the beautiful coastal regions of our world?"

    ### JUNGLE ###
    building_sustainable_agriculture_plant:0 "Sustainable Agricultural Plant"
    building_sustainable_agriculture_plant_desc:0 "The planet is one large jungle covered in trees and roots throughout the surface. However, we can use this to our advantage: the planet's temperate conditions offers a unique environment for the cultivation of some of the most coveted fruits in the galaxy. We can construct a sustainable agricultural plant on this world and exploit that natural resource. "

    ### BIOLUMINESCENT ###
    building_exotic_hunting_lodge:0 "Exotic Hunting Lodge"
    building_exotic_hunting_lodge_desc:0 "This world's unique geothermal activity has given rise to something not common on most other worlds: a biosphere that almost universally employs bioluminescence for a variety of different functions. This fauna has a particular distinct look and, especially, taste, and would make for an exquisite luxury item on the dinner table."

    ### MARSH ###
    building_water_drainage_system:0 "Water Drainage System"
    building_water_drainage_system_desc:0 "This world has long been a good colony of our empire, and we should take care to keep it that way. However, our colonists grow tired of the extensively drowned areas of this world; perhaps we could invest in localised water drainage systems to push water away from our areas of habitability, allowing construction to continue and grow unimpeded. "

    ### MANGROVE ###
    building_stilted_community:0 "Stilted Community"
    building_stilted_community_desc:0 "Because of how waterlogged this planet is many have taken to building on platforms held above the water by large beams. We can expand this technique and create entire communities using this style of construction to allow for a more conventional style of living on a very unconventional world."

    ### BOG ###
    building_hydroponics_platforms:0 "Hydroponics Platforms"
    building_hydroponics_platforms_desc:0 "This planet does not have a great surface to speak of, mostly covered in a disgusting mix of gunk and mudded water. However, the soil is extremely fertile and the world's humidity makes it possible to cultivate a wide variety of different agricultural products. We should invest resources in establishing platforms that allow us to exploit this advantage."

    ### LAKE ### 
    building_maraetropian_dams:0 "Maraetropian Dams"
    building_maraetropian_dams_desc:0 "We can construct a series of massive dams which block the rivers feeding the abundant lakes of this world. This would create an artificial sea which we could control to draw power for our machines and grant us better control of the rivers downstream."

    ### PRAIRIE ###
    building_wilderness_retreat:0 "Wilderness Retreat"
    building_wilderness_retreat_desc:0 "This planet's massive plains and grasslands are extremely fertile and can be exploited for agriculture, but that is not all they are useful for. The peace and tranquility of being surrounded by hundreds of miles of empty space  allows for the construction of massive retreat estates to disconnect from society."

    ### TEMPERATE ###
    building_wind_farm:0 "Wind Farm"
    building_wind_farm_desc:0 "Though some might disagree, heat and warmth has its advantages. In this particular case, the planet's lukewarm surface temperature causes an uptick in the temperature of the air currents around it, which pushes the air up and shifts cooler airs back down, creating strong winds that can be exploited by our colony for energy production. "

    ### FOREST ###
    building_athsean_lumber_yard:0 "Athsean Lumber Yard"
    building_athsean_lumber_yard_desc:0 "A small community built in the remote forrest wildlands of the planet with the intention of turning the copious amount of local trees into usable lumber that can benefit our people. Some question the minimal amount of oversight that exists in these communities but to develop the area nearby would be to defeat its purpose."

    ### SUPERCONTINENT ###
    building_transcontinental_monorail_system:0 "Transcontinental Monorail System"
    building_transcontinental_monorail_system_desc:0 "Transportation across the various population centres of our colonies is a key aspect of the growth and sustainability of our worlds. Other worlds must contend establishing such centres on various continents and find various ways to transport goods, people and services across these continents. Not on this world, though; here, we have the Transcontinental Monorail, a vast network of trains and railways which connected every corner of the planet's entire land surface together. "

    ### HOT OCEAN ###
    building_hydrothermal_generator_system:0 "Hydrothermal Generator System"
    building_hydrothermal_generator_system_desc:0 "We can use the incredibly violent waters of this world to generate power in amounts that are almost inconceivable on other worlds. While it would require a significant amount of custom construction and new equipment the potential benefits seem to be worth the investment."

    ### COLD OCEAN ###
    building_subsurface_infrastructure:0 "Subsurface Infrastructure"
    building_subsurface_infrastructure_desc:0 "Thanks to this planets extremely calm and gentle waters it is possible for us to actually build structures beneath the massive ocean for our people to use."

    building_tempests_demise_desc:0 "This massive complex juts off of one of the many rocky cliffs that are scattered across the planets surface. After several failed attempts a design was created capable of handling the intense storms that this planet regularly throws at its small landmass. Many say that it is magic but the superstitious having to fear from our advanced engineer techniques. "

    ### BOREAL ###
    building_geothermal_station:0 "Geothermal Station"
    building_geothermal_station_desc:0 "This planet's receding ice age has revealed a number of geothermal vents on the surface, an excellent source of energy for a nascent colony on this world. It would be criminally negligent to allow such an opportunity for our colony to be energetically self-sufficient pass us by. "

    ### HIGHLAND ###
    building_distillery_complex:0 "Distillery Complex"
    building_distillery_complex_desc:0 "There is something about these lands that simply inspires the creation of mild intoxicant beverages. Strong enough to notice while still being safe to consume several times a day without high risk of dying. The locals seem to take a strong sense of pride in these drinks and people far and wide have begun paying handsome sums in order to acquire small portions for themselves."

    ### CASCADIAN ###
    building_mountain_compounds:0 "Mountain Compounds"
    building_mountain_compounds_desc:0 "We can take advantage of the plethora of mountains on this world by tunnelling deep into the larger mountains and using these incredibly secure locations to house materials that we feel are worthy of such protection. A similar process can also be done to give the local population more space for their communities as there is not much land suitable to urbanization in the narrow valleys of the world. "

    ### CRAG ###
    building_aero_mining_base:0 "Aero Mining Base"
    building_aero_mining_base_desc:0 "The small archipelagos on this planet are equal parts mineral rich and remote which poses a challenge for mining operations. A unique system of airlifting teams and supplies onto one of the tiny islands for a brief period of time before rotating them out alongside the resources that they could procure seems to be the most efficient, although not the cheapest, option."

    ### BASALT ###
    building_construction_industrial_complex:0 "Construction Industrial Complex"
    building_construction_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Basalt rock is relatively mundane in and of itself, but is actually an extremely useful resource.  Its importance in the construction industry is unmatched, and heavily investing in the development of that industry on this planet will allow us to build a reliable source of raw materials for construction across our empire."

    ### LICHEN ###
    building_lichen_harvesting_facility:0 "Lichen Harvesting Facility"
    building_lichen_harvesting_facility_desc:0 "Lichens are incredible at absorbing polutants and breaking down waste that are usually not considered biodegradable. We can harvest the abundant lichens on this planet and send them to other worlds to allow for more industrial production with less of the enviormental risks. The same function can be used to detect natural contamination of the enviorment or detect dangerous pollutants leaking into our habitats."

    ### MIRE ###
    building_mudslide_barriers:0 "Mudslide Barriers"
    building_mudslide_barriers_desc:0 "This planet has near constant mudslides that in many ways are closer to mud rivers than the mudslides we have expereinced on other planets. In order to establish concentrated urban areas we need to ensure that these mudslides do not sweep through and carry away our infrastructure. Building large barriers seems to be the most direct way or ensuring that our habitated regions are safe."

    ### MYCELIUM ###
    building_green_zone:0 "Green Zone"
    building_green_zone_desc:0 "On a world as hostile as #name small areas can be cleared and developed to a semblance of our more hospitable worlds. While it is difficult and dangerous it allows our people to live in relative safety until they need to venture beyond the protective boundaries and enter the harsh and unforgiving nature."

    ### SNOW ###
    building_planetary_train:0 "Planetary Train"
    building_planetary_train_desc:0 "The question of how to generate enough heat to survive on worlds as inhospitable as #name has long been a topic of discussion. Some of our more unorthodox engineers have pondered the idea of using a massive train that spans the planet as a moving city that generates its own heat through its engines and friction with the tracks and air."

    ### GLACIAL ###
    building_the_generator:0 "The Generator"
    building_the_generator_desc:0 "A massive steam generator forms a relatively safe circle around it where out people can live in some semblance of comfort. So long as it is supplied with a constant stream of flammable rocks it will captain our citizens through even the harshest blizzard"

    ### ANTARCTIC ###
    building_underground_vault:0 "Vault of Life"
    building_underground_vault_desc:0 "This vault is designed to retain a physical copy of all the planets that our people require for life. From foods to decorative flora it is stored deep under the frozen ground should it ever become necessary for us to rebuild our ecosystem from scratch."
