Climatic disasters, running out of resources, and overpopulation have forced us to seek new opportunities outside our home planet [GetHomeWorldName]. We built high-tech stations that allowed us to live and work on planets without suitable atmospheres. For a long time, the colonies provided their home planet with everything it needed, but it didn't last. The colonies' complicated dependence on the center and unequal social conditions have led society to contradictions that are about to escalate into conflict. \But all this will be in the past, because now, with the invention of the hyperdrive, new doors are opening for us... and new opportunities."
