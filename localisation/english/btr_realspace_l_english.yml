  pc_magnetar_desc:0 "Magnetars are neutron stars with an extremely strong magnetic field and an extremely high density. They may have a higher gravitation than a some black holes. Magnetars are capable of emitting such strong flashes of gamma and X-ray radiation, that they can damage electronic equipment located billions of kilometers from the star. The average life span of a magnetar is about 1 million years. Because of the strong magnetic field, movement around the magnetar is difficult, and the radiation emitted, disrupts the operation of reflectors, rendering the shields of ships and stations useless."

This mod focuses on the variety of inhabited and uninhabited worlds in the galaxy and makes them more interesting with the help of many events and features, some of which are new interesting mechanics.\n\nThe variety of planet types is achieved through the addition of §Wsubclasses§! for existing planetary classes. §WSubclasses§! are special modifiers that affect the appearance and other characteristics of the planet. They are of four types: §Bnormal§!, §Rextreme§!, §Graysky§! and §Mexotic§!.\n\nThe second important feature of this mod is the addition of §Wcatastrophic events§!.
