  ### SETUP TECHNOLOGIES ###
 tech_production_increase:0 "Industrial Revolution"
 tech_production_increase_desc:0 "You know how life is short and everything well time is shorter in Stellaris and the Realism is hard so we increased production for every empire <3"
 ### RARE RESOURCES ###

 tech_mine_element_zero:0 "Element Zero Mining"
 tech_mine_element_zero_desc:0 "Element Zero is often only formed in systems with Neutron stars and Pulsars. As these are dangerous places to mine, it usually requires extensive use of robotics, telepresence, and shielding to survive the intense radiation."
 tech_mine_helium_3:0 "Helium-3 Extraction"
 tech_mine_helium_3_desc:0 "Helium-3 can often be found in the atmospheres of gas giants, from where it can be easily and cheaply skimmed."

 ### MASS EFFECT DRIVES ###
 tech_mass_effect_drive_1:0 "Element Zero Core Infusion"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_1_desc:0 "When Element Zero is subjected to an electrical current, it releases dark energy which can be manipulated into a Mass Effect field, raising or lowering the mass of all objects within that field. This effectively raises the speed of light within the Mass Effect field, allowing high speed travel with negligible relativistic time dilation effects. This can be applied to our FTL drives to greatly improve efficiency."
 tech_mass_effect_drive_2:0 "Element Zero Concentration"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_2_desc:0 "Further research into the effects of Element Zero on our FTL drives has revealed potential improvements. By concentrating Element Zero into a purer form, it results in a notable decrease to the mass of a starship, further increasing FTL velocities."
 tech_mass_effect_drive_3:0 "Element Zero Experiementation"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_3_desc:0 "By combining Element Zero with different quantum and subatomic particles, we are able to improve the efficiency of our Element Zero infused FTL cores by at least 10 percent."
 tech_mass_effect_drive_4:0 "Mass Effect Field Stabilisation"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_4_desc:0 "Until now, Mass Effect fields generated by Element Zero have been naturally unstable when ships are travelling at extreme FTL velocities. However, further particle physics research has given us a better understanding of how these fields are formed. This research has allowed ships to safely surpass previous speed limitations."
 tech_mass_effect_drive_5:0 "Element Zero FTL Limits"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_5_desc:0 "Continued experimentation on FTL drives infused with Element Zero has recently been quite slow. Our scientists have made a few minor improvements to our current generation of FTL drives but have warned us further research is unlikely to return major results. However, they have proposed that we stop trying to improve standard FTL drives and instead construct a pure Element Zero drive core. We have been warned that this will be a long and resource intensive task however."
 tech_mine_eezo_extraction:0 "Element Zero Extraction"
 tech_mine_eezo_extraction_desc:0 "Eezo is generated when solid matter, such as a planet, is affected by the energy of a star going supernova. The material is common in the asteroid debris that orbits neutron stars and pulsars. These are dangerous places to mine, requiring extensive use of robotics, telepresence, and shielding to survive the intense radiation from the dead star. We now know how to safely harvest this volatile resource."
 element_zero_deficit:0 "Element Zero Deficit"
