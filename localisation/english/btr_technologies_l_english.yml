 ### MASS EFFECT DRIVES ###
 tech_mass_effect_drive_1:0 "Element Zero Core Infusion"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_1_desc:0 "When Element Zero is subjected to an electrical current, it releases dark energy which can be manipulated into a Mass Effect field, raising or lowering the mass of all objects within that field. This effectively raises the speed of light within the Mass Effect field, allowing high speed travel with negligible relativistic time dilation effects. This can be applied to our FTL drives to greatly improve efficiency."
 tech_mass_effect_drive_2:0 "Element Zero Concentration"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_2_desc:0 "Further research into the effects of Element Zero on our FTL drives has revealed potential improvements. By concentrating Element Zero into a purer form, it results in a notable decrease to the mass of a starship, further increasing FTL velocities."
 tech_mass_effect_drive_3:0 "Element Zero Experiementation"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_3_desc:0 "By combining Element Zero with different quantum and subatomic particles, we are able to improve the efficiency of our Element Zero infused FTL cores by at least 10 percent."
 tech_mass_effect_drive_4:0 "Mass Effect Field Stabilisation"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_4_desc:0 "Until now, Mass Effect fields generated by Element Zero have been naturally unstable when ships are travelling at extreme FTL velocities. However, further particle physics research has given us a better understanding of how these fields are formed. This research has allowed ships to safely surpass previous speed limitations."
 tech_mass_effect_drive_5:0 "Element Zero FTL Limits"
 tech_mass_effect_drive_5_desc:0 "Continued experimentation on FTL drives infused with Element Zero has recently been quite slow. Our scientists have made a few minor improvements to our current generation of FTL drives but have warned us further research is unlikely to return major results. However, they have proposed that we stop trying to improve standard FTL drives and instead construct a pure Element Zero drive core. We have been warned that this will be a long and resource intensive task however."
 tech_mine_eezo_extraction:0 "Element Zero Extraction"
 tech_mine_eezo_extraction_desc:0 "Eezo is generated when solid matter, such as a planet, is affected by the energy of a star going supernova. The material is common in the asteroid debris that orbits neutron stars and pulsars.

 tech_geth_sphere_phys:0 "Geth Sphere"
 tech_geth_sphere_phys_desc:0 "The Geth have long wished to be truly unified rather than operating based on the clumsy and inefficient linked system that they currently use. To this end they developed a megastructure that could allow them to all share thoughts and opinions at once without delay. The completion of such would see the Geth largely vanish from the galactic stage into a paradise of their own design."
 tech_geth_sphere_soc:0 "Geth Sphere Operational Coding"
 tech_geth_sphere_soc_desc:0 "The physical shell of our megastructure is only half of our collective dream. It is nothing but a metal ball without the ability of us to inhabit it and thrive within the virtual realm we create inside of it. That virtual existence will not create itself and we must create the most robust operating system in the galaxy in order to handle everything that we plan on creating."

### Vol Protectorate Technology

tech_volus_protective_suits:0 "Protective Suits"
tech_volus_protective_suits_desc:0 "Our protective suits have become the image of our species in the minds of every other race in the milky way. The highly customizable nature of these suits allows them to fulfill a plethora of roles while also allowing us to travel beyond the limited number of habitable worlds available to us."
tech_volus_government_structures:0 "Adaptive Government Structures"
tech_volus_government_structures_desc:0 "One of the most confusing aspects of the Volus society to outsiders is its government. Instead of the rigid and ever present institutions, processes, and organizations that most other species use to govern themselves, the Volus use a highly fluid government system. The concept of “departments” or “agencies” is alien to the Volus, replaced with decentralized organizations that eb and flow along with the task that they perform. In some cases, government organizations exist without any relation to one another except for the fact that they have received authority to regulate some aspect of society."

### Illumintaed Primacy

tech_hanar_gravity_drives:0 "Contra-Gravity Drives"
