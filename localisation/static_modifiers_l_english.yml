 asari_rep_empire_modifier:0 "The Many Armies of the Asari Republics"
 btr_asrep_empire_modifier_desc:0 "Although answering to Thessian High Command, every republic, be it in Thessia itself or beyond, maintains its own army, with their own twist on command structure, equipment, training and tactics. Few things are common among all of them though, such as emphasis on quality over numbers, fluidity and mobility, biotic skills, guerilla tactics and training each skill to perfection over decades, if not hundreds of years of training and practice."

 turian_hier_relay_314_desc:0 "Due to the rather surprising manner in which our forces were routed at the Alliance colony of Shanxi, morale amongst the troops has hit a surprising low in the light of how an inferior force was able to counter our might.

 systems_all_shanxi_memory_desc:0 "The First Contact War and the lingering memories of the Turian's brutal attack on Shanxi still festers in the hearts and minds of the citizens of the Alliance, driving them to work harder, train better, and flock to join the Navy so they may be better prepared for when another unprovoked attack may come..."
 systems_all_traverse_race:0 "§RRace for the Traverse§"
 systems_all_traverse_race_desc:0 "As survey efforts continue in the Attican Traverse, the surrounding civilizations engage in a race to seize and exploit the many bounties of resources and habitable planets in it's systems.
