 ### Asari Republics Modifiers
 asari_rep_empire_modifier:0 "The Many Armies of the Asari Republics"
 btr_asrep_empire_modifier_desc:0 "Although answering to Thessian High Command, every republic, be it in Thessia itself or beyond, maintains its own army, with their own twist on command structure, equipment, training and tactics. Few things are common among all of them though, such as emphasis on quality over numbers, fluidity and mobility, biotic skills, guerilla tactics and training each skill to perfection over decades, if not hundreds of years of training and practice."

 ### Turian Hierarchy Modifiers
 turian_hier_empire_modifier:0 "Economic Inefficiency"
 turian_hier_empire_modifier_desc:0 "Turians make fine soldiers, but poor entrepreneurs. The Volus make natural traders but lack martial inclination. In exchange for our protection, they will finance our peace efforts."
 turian_hier_relay_314:0 "§BRelay-314 Reprecussions§"
 turian_hier_relay_314_desc:0 "Due to the rather surprising manner in which our forces were routed at the Alliance colony of Shanxi, morale amongst the troops has hit a surprising low in the light of how an inferior force was able to counter our might. This has also led to an unfortunate loss of reputation for our fleets within the galactic community....Something we must rectify immediately."
