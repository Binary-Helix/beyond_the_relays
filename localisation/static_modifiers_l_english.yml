 turian_hier_relay_314_desc:0 "Due to the rather surprising manner in which our forces were routed at the Alliance colony of Shanxi, morale amongst the troops has hit a surprising low in the light of how an inferior force was able to counter our might.

 systems_all_shanxi_memory_desc:0 "The First Contact War and the lingering memories of the Turian's brutal attack on Shanxi still festers in the hearts and minds of the citizens of the Alliance, driving them to work harder, train better, and flock to join the Navy so they may be better prepared for when another unprovoked attack may come..."

 sedriicae_stagnation:0 "Symptoms of Stagnation"
 sedriicae_stagnation_desc:0 "We are overextended, it's undeniable. For too many decades we have stuck to our current Hundred-Year Plan, unable to adapt to the new circumstances.
