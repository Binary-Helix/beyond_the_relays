 ### Asari Republics Modifiers
 asari_rep_empire_modifier:0 "The Many Armies of the Asari Republics"
 btr_asrep_empire_modifier_desc:0 "Although answering to Thessian High Command, every republic, be it in Thessia itself or beyond, maintains its own army, with their own twist on command structure, equipment, training and tactics. Few things are common among all of them though, such as emphasis on quality over numbers, fluidity and mobility, biotic skills, guerilla tactics and training each skill to perfection over decades, if not hundreds of years of training and practice."

 ### Turian Hierarchy Modifiers
 turian_hier_empire_modifier:0 "Economic Inefficiency"
 turian_hier_empire_modifier_desc:0 "Turians make fine soldiers, but poor entrepreneurs. The Volus make natural traders but lack martial inclination. In exchange for our protection, they will finance our peace efforts."
 turian_hier_relay_314:0 "§BRelay-314 Reprecussions§"
 turian_hier_relay_314_desc:0 "Due to the rather surprising manner in which our forces were routed at the Alliance colony of Shanxi, morale amongst the troops has hit a surprising low in the light of how an inferior force was able to counter our might. This has also led to an unfortunate loss of reputation for our fleets within the galactic community....Something we must rectify immediately."

 ### Systems Alliance Modifiers ###
 systems_all_empire_modifier:0 "Per Ardua Ad Aspera"
 systems_all_empire_modifier_desc:0 "Since humanity discovered the mass effect fields thanks to the research of the Prothean ruins on Mars, the Alliance has spearheaded the enormous expansion of humans on the galaxy, with the resource wealth of a dozen settled colonies and hundreds of industrial outposts flowing back to an overpopulated Earth. This expansion doesn't show signs of stopping any time soon, much to the chagrin of alien races."
 systems_all_shanxi_memory:0 "§BMemory of Shanxi§!"
 systems_all_shanxi_memory_desc:0 "The First Contact War and the lingering memories of the Turian's brutal attack on Shanxi still festers in the hearts and minds of the citizens of the Alliance, driving them to work harder, train better, and flock to join the Navy so they may be better prepared for when another unprovoked attack may come..."
 systems_all_traverse_race:0 "§RRace for the Traverse§"
 systems_all_traverse_race_desc:0 "As survey efforts continue in the Attican Traverse, the surrounding civilizations engage in a race to seize and exploit the many bounties of resources and habitable planets in it's systems. This has led to heightened tensions between the Systems Alliance and Batarian Hegemony in recent years and could result in an outbreak of conflict between these two powers."
